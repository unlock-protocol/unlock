# The paywall

The paywall is an application which can be added to any website to check if a visitor is a member.
It also offers the ability to open a "checkout" UI which lets the user purchase a key to any of the locks configured for that page.

## Module

A npm module `@unlock-protocol/paywall` is offered for convenience to export and easily add an Unlock paywall to any site without "hotloading" the code from the unlock servers.
