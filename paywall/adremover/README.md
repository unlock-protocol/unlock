# Ad Remover sample

This is a temporary forlder (to be removed after July 1st 2019) which will provide an example of a creator using our paywall to implement an ad remover.

This static site is meant to be served as a full static HTML file, using npm's `serve` or python `python3 -m http.server` (older versions of python can use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`).

This fake publisher site is a simple HTML document with 2 ads loaded by default and a button to purchase an ad free experience of the content.
