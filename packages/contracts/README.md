# Contracts

### Javascript usage

```js

// get latest
import unlock from '@unlock-protocol/abis/Unlock'

unlock.abi;
unlock.address; // if available

// get previous versions
import unlock from '@unlock-protocol/abis/UnlockV0'

```


### Solidity usage

NB: all the contracts have been flattened and exist mostly for archiving.

```solidity

import "@unlock-protocol/contracts/Unlock/UnlockV0.sol";

```
