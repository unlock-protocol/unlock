# unlock-js

Unlock-js is a npm module which provides a wrapper around the Unlock smart contract ABIs to simnplify interractions with the protocols smart contracts (both Unlock and PublicLock).

It is used in production by the Unlock front-end applications and can be deployed both on server side (node.js) applications and front end applications (using your favorite JavaScript framework).

One of the core goals of this library is to abstract the complexity of the multiple Unlock and PublicLock versions with a single library. It covers some of the data type conversions so that API calls are more user friendly (strings instead of BigInts).

You can find more docs and detailed usage examples in [Unlock's main documentation](https://docs.unlock-protocol.com/developers/unlock.js).
