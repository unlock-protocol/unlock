# Networks

You should **not need to deploy an Unlock contract yourself**. Here are the addresses of contracts deployed on respective networks and you can call them directly using the block explorer.

## Package
Included in the core protocol is a networks package. 

<a href="https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock/tree/master/packages/networks">
  <button class="button button-primary margin-bottom--md">
    <GoMarkGithub className='react-icons' /> Unlock Repo / Networks Subdirectory
  </button>
</a>

This package includes all of the network addresses as well as [rpc endpoints](../../tools/rpc-provider.md) that you can use for development environments.

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@unlock-protocol/networks">
  <button class="button button-primary margin-bottom--md">
    <SiNpm className='react-icons' /> npm @unlock-protocol/networks
  </button>
</a> 

### Adding it in your project

using yarn
\`\`\`shell
yarn add @unlock-protocol/networks
\`\`\`
or npm
\`\`\`shell
npm i @unlock-protocol/networks
\`\`\`

## Deployments

${Object.keys(networks)
  .filter((chainId) => chainId !== '31337')
  .map((chainId) => parseNetwork(networks[chainId]))
  .join('')}
`
