This is a production deployment. Please treat with great caution!
This deploys the code from master as of commit $STABLE_MASTER.

Reviewing code for this Pull Request is not practical, however, you are asked to check wether the current staging environment is stable and could be released. For this, follow these steps:

* [ ] Go to http://staging.unlock-protocol.com/ and ensure that the website loads fine.

## Creator Dashboard
* [ ] Click on the \"Go to your Dashboard\" button and ensure that the dashboard loads as expected
* [ ] Create a new Lock (you will need some Rinkeby Eth) and wait for it to confirm with the right values
* [ ] Update the price on this new lock or an older lock

## Paywall
* [ ] Go to https://www.ouvre-boite.com/members-staging/ and make sure the paywall is in place (no scrolling)
* [ ] Purchase a key and ensure that the optimistic paywall lets you access the content (scrolling works)
* [ ] Wait 5 minutes (the key should expire) and reload the page
* [ ] Purchase another key

Feel free to test the dashboard and paywal using a mobile browser.
