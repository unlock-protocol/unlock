## Airdrop Terms and Conditions

Effective Date: February 2025

Last Updated: February 2025

These Airdrop Terms and Conditions (“**Terms**”) govern your participation in the airdrop program (the “**Airdrop**”) offered by Unlock Protocol Foundation (“**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”). The purpose of the Airdrop is to distribute Unlock Protocol (UP) (“**Tokens**”) to eligible participants as part of our broader ecosystem growth and governance initiative. By claiming, receiving, or using any Tokens distributed through the Airdrop, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not participate in the Airdrop.

For the purposes of these Terms, references to our “Website” refer to [https://airdrops.unlock-protocol.com/](https://airdrops.unlock-protocol.com/)

   3. We make no representations or warranties regarding the future value or liquidity of the Tokens.

3) **Old and New Airdrop Provisions**

   1. The Airdrop consists of both a new distribution and a prior distribution of Tokens completed on November 1st 2024.

   5. The Foundation reserves the right to revoke eligibility for any participant found to have violated these Terms in connection with either the prior or current Airdrop.

   6. To mitigate risks, participants who were eligible for previous distributions may be required to check an additional confirmation box to acknowledge the past distribution terms.

   7. If an airdrop recipient disagrees with the basis of the prior airdrop, they may return the Tokens, and failure to do so will be considered acceptance of these Terms.

   4. Claiming through any method other than the designated front-end interface may forfeit eligibility.

   5. The Foundation may implement measures to store proof of agreement, ensuring compliance in the event of regulatory scrutiny.

5) **Restrictions on Use**
