# Unlock Assets

This library isolates the Unlock SVG components for simplicity.

Add SVG to `/image`, then run the following commands:

* `npm run svg-2-components` to generate components again
* `npm run build` to build the React components
* `npm publish` to publish new version!


You can tweak the default viewBox for each image by looking at `src/components.js`
