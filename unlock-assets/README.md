# Unlock Assets

This library isolates the Unlock SVG components for simplicity.
Made with [create-react-library](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/create-react-library#readme)

Add SVG to `/image`, then run the following commands:

- `npm run svg-2-components` to generate components again
- `npm run build` to build the React components
- `npm publish` to publish new version!

You can tweak the default viewBox for each image by looking at `src/components.js`
