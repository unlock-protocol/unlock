Your NFT ticket to EthCC has been sent to your wallet! Congrats!
For now, there is not much else you need to do. It should be visible on any NFT marketplace, but you can also see it in your Unlock key-chain:

${params.keychainUrl}

Once we get closer to the date of the event, we will send you instructions on how to make sure you can easily check-in.
In the meantime, please, join a dedicated Spkz lounger for EthCC attendees!
  
If you have any questions , please email us at hello@unlock-protocol.com.
