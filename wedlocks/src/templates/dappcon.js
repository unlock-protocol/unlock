<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Please, find attached to this email a QR code that you will need to bring on Monday next week at the DappCon venue.</p>

<p>If you have already received another QR code, that's ok; You can bring either... We just wanted to make sure everyone had received at least one.</p>

<p>Finally, you can always view your NFT in the <a href="https://app.unlock-protocol.com/keychain">Unlock Protocol keychain</a>! 

<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>The DappCon Team</p>`,
