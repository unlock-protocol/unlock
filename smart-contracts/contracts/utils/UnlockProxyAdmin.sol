/**
 * @dev This contract implements a proxy that is upgradeable by an admin.
 *
 * To avoid https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/malicious-backdoors-in-ethereum-proxies-62629adf3357[proxy selector
 * clashing], which can potentially be used in an attack, this contract uses the
 * https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-transparent-proxy-pattern/[transparent proxy pattern]. This pattern implies two
 * things that go hand in hand:
 *
 * 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if
 * that call matches one of the admin functions exposed by the proxy itself.
 * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can access the admin functions, but its calls will never be forwarded to the
 * implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error that says
 * "admin cannot fallback to proxy target".
 *
 * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for admin actions like upgrading the proxy or changing
 * the admin, so it's best if it's a dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due
 * to sudden errors when trying to call a function from the proxy implementation.
 *
 * Our recommendation is for the dedicated account to be an instance of the {ProxyAdmin} contract. If set up this way,
 * you should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the real administrative interface of your proxy.
 *
 * NOTE: The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not
 * inherit from that interface, and instead the admin functions are implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch
 * mechanism in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to
 * fully implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the
 * implementation.
 *
 * WARNING: It is not recommended to extend this contract to add additional external functions. If you do so, the compiler
 * will not check that there are no selector conflicts, due to the note above. A selector clash between any new function
 * and the functions declared in {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy} will be resolved in favor of the new one. This could
 * render the admin operations inaccessible, which could prevent upgradeability. Transparency may also be compromised.
