# Locksmith

Locksmith is a backend service that prvovides some services in the context of Unlock.
None of these services are required to use the core-protocol.
Among these services, locksmith provides the following:

- NFT metadata hosting
- membership metadata hosting
- Unlock accounts

The locksmith application has several entry points. By default it provides an API server, but could also be run for our `websub` worker. For the latter, prefix all commands with `websub:` (for example: `yarn run websub:dev`)

## Getting Started

### Configure Database

Locksmith uses postgres under the hood.

To start, you can spin up a local instance of postgres using docker by running `docker run --name locksmith-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -d postgres` or go with a traditional install or hosting provider.

1. Configure environment variables (Locksmith will recognize these placed in
   an `.env.dev.local` file at the root of the monorepo)

   If you used the docker command above, just add
   `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres` (you may need to replace the IP)

   Alternatively, you could set these variables:

   - `DB_USERNAME` - Database User
   - `DB_PASSWORD` - Password of User
   - `DB_NAME` - Database Name
   - `DB_HOSTNAME` - Database Host

   **Note**: The following can be used to quickly get started setting up your **local development** database.

   You will also need to add the following env var: `DEFAULT_NETWORK=1`

### Running tests

Once the database has been configured (per above), make sure to migrate by calling `yarn run db:migrate` and then call `yarn run test:run`.

### Running Locksmith

For running in production, use `yarn start` otherwise `yarn dev` which will restart the server on file changes.
