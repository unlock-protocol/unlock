## What Personal Information does Unlock collect?

The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve the Services and Services. We collect the following types of information from our users:

Personal Information You Provide to Us: In order to use certain features of the Services, you must first connect your Ethereum wallet to the Services. We receive and may store any information you enter via the Services or which is provided to us in any other way. Some of the information we collect and store could be personally identifiable information (**“Personal Information”**) which may include your Ethereum address, name, physical or mailing address, email address, phone number, credit card and/or other payment information, IP address, browser information, use information, username, password, and any other information necessary for us to provide the Services.

You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of our features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, sending product updates, and communicating with you about Unlock’s products and services, including specials and new features.

### Personal Information Collected Automatically

- We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Services. Unlock automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.

- Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Services and its components. We only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of Services so that we can make the Services appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use the Services. We may share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use the Services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Unlock never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.

E-mail Communications: We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Unlock if your computer supports this type of program. Unlock uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users. When you receive e-mail from Unlock, you can opt out of receiving further e-mails by following the included instructions to unsubscribe.

### What about Cookies?

- Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Please note that we may use cookies to enhance visitors’ experiences, to learn more about their use of the Services and to improve quality.

- Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of the Services most attractive features.

## Will Unlock share any of the Personal Information it receives?

Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only as described below. We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction.

**Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control**: We anticipate that we may become affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses may sell items to you through the Services. In other situations, Unlock may provide services, or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business.

**Contractors**: We engage with other companies and individuals to perform tasks on our behalf and may need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, Unlock’s suppliers do not have any right to use your Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of your Personal Information for the above purposes.

**User profiles**: User profile information including users’ name, email address, and other information you enter (“User Submissions”) may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services. Email addresses are used to add new User Submissions to user profiles and to communicate through User Submissions. Users’ email addresses will not be directly revealed to other users by Unlock, except, when the user is “connected” to another user via a shared group membership, or an invitation, or if the user has chosen to include their email address in their user profile.

**Communication in response to User Submissions**: As part of the Services, you will receive from Unlock email and other communication relating to your User Submissions. You acknowledge and agree that by posting such User Submissions, Unlock may send you email and other communication that it determines in its sole discretion relate to your User Submissions.

**Promotional Offers**: We may send offers to you on behalf of other businesses. However, when we do so, we do not give the other business your name and address. If you do not wish to receive these offers, please send an email with your request to hello@unlock-protocol.com.

**Business Transfers**: Unlock may go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or portion of our assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if Unlock, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Unlock goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Unlock may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as subject to the acquirer’s policy.

**Protection of Unlock and Others**: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Unlock, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. You acknowledge and consent to such disclosure.

**Compliance with the Agreement**: We may use Personal Information to the extent it is required to enforce or apply our Agreement [INSERT AS LINK TO TERMS OF USE] and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes.

**With Your Consent**: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.

## Are there Risks with Transactions using Blockchain?

To properly use and obtain benefit from the Services, you will need to connect to the Ethereum wallet blockchain. Please be aware that Unlock has no ownership, control or responsibility related to any blockchain technology, including Ethereum, and your connection with any third party site or technology is solely at your own risk. Be aware that when you use the Unlock Website, the following information may be written onto the Ethereum blockchain:

- the cryptographic wallet address from which you submitted the transaction;

- the amount of the cryptocurrency which you send or receive; or

- the cryptographic wallet address to which you initiated the transaction.

A blockchain’s records cannot be changed or deleted. This may affect your ability to exercise your rights such as your right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”), the right to rectification of your data or your rights to object or restrict processing of your Personal Information. Data, including Personal Information, written to the Ethereum blockchain is public and cannot be erased.

## Is Personal Information about me secure?

Your Personal Information associated with your account is protected by your wallet for your privacy and security. We have implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. It is your responsibility to ensure that there is no unauthorized access to your account and information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your devices, including your computer and browser at all times, including when you sign off after you have finished accessing your account.

Unfortunately, be aware that the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Unlock cannot guarantee the security of user account information and unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of your user information at any time. If you are not comfortable with the inherent risks, do not share or provide Personal Information to the Services.

The Website contains links to other sites and technologies. Unlock is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites or with regard to other technologies. When linking to another site or technology, you should read the privacy policy stated on that site and only proceed forward if you are comfortable with the practices and policies.

## What Personal Information can I access?

If Unlock stores any of your account information, you will be able to review and change your Personal Information stored by Unlock by logging into the Services and visiting your account profile page.

You may also send us an email at [hello@unlock-protocol.com](mailto:hello@unlock-protocol.com) to request access to, correct or delete any Personal Information that you have provided to us. We cannot delete your Personal Information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.

If you delete any of your user contributions from the Services, copies of these contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other Website users.

## What choices do I have?

As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information, even though it may be needed to take advantage of certain features of the Services.

- If Unlock stores any of your account information, you will be able to add or update certain information on pages, such as those listed in the “What Personal Information can I access” section above. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.

- You may request deletion of your account information from our servers by sending an e-mail to [hello@unlock-protocol.com](mailto:hello@unlock-protocol.com). Please note that some information may remain in our records after deletion of your account. Re control any blockc information present on the Ethereum blockchain or other decentralized networks at any time. Your use of any blockchain technologies are at your own risk.

- If you do not wish to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate this preference during the registration process. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.

## Can Unlock make changes to this Privacy Policy?

Unlock may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services or sending you an email. Users are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such changes have been first posted.

## What if I have questions or concerns?

If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy on the Services, please send us a detailed message at [hello@unlock-protocol.com](mailto:hello@unlock-protocol.com). We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.
