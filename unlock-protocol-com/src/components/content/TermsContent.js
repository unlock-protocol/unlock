        sale or otherwise in connection with using the Services, or if you have
        a dispute with such third party, you must resolve the dispute directly
        with that third party. If you believe a third party has behaved in a
        fraudulent, misleading, or inappropriate manner, or if you cannot
        adequately resolve a dispute with a third party, you may notify Unlock
        Support at{' '}
        <a href="mailto:hello@unlock-protocol.com">hello@unlock-protocol.com</a>
