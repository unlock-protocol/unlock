<p>Welcome to this week's Unlock DAO newsletter! I am excited to share the latest updates from last week's DAO call, highlighting key developments, new initiatives, and upcoming events that are shaping the future of our community. Let's dive into the exciting news that's propelling Unlock DAO forward.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-surfing-on-entropy-soe-by-postarchitekt"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out sh-color-blue sh-color" href="https://discord.com/channels/462280183425138719/1224426426053431430">Surfing On Entropy (SOE) by PostArchitekt</a></h3></div><p>PostArchitekt presented a comprehensive report about the project he has been working on: Surfing On Entropy. It is a story-based game gated with Unlock Memberships. He is requesting more people to beta test so he can launch the educational pod around Unlock Protocol. Read the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out sh-color-blue sh-color" href="https://surfingonentropy.com/labyrinth-of-sound-enter/">full story</a> and join the group of beta testers <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out sh-color-blue sh-color" href="https://surfingonentropy.com/unlocking-your-journey">here</a>. Ccarfi also suggested we do a life demo maybe during December for more people to join!</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-newsletter-update-enhancing-our-communication">Newsletter Update: Enhancing Our Communication</h3></div><p>PostArchitekt also shared updates on our newsletter initiative. Yes, the very same letter you are currently reading. To make my life a bit easier he built and AI that captures the main points of our weekly conversations. Last week we tested for the first time an automated workflow that sends the newsletter automatically to Chris so he can post it via the Unlock Paragraph page. Check the one out from last week <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out sh-color-blue sh-color" href="https://paragraph.xyz/@unlockprotocol/unlock-dao-weekly-newsletter-or-november-12,-2024?referrer=0xD2BC5cb641aE6f7A880c3dD5Aee0450b5210BE23">here</a>. These improvements aim to keep our community better informed and more connected with Unlock DAO's progress and opportunities.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-proposal-presentation-pizza-dao-event-during-tulum-crypto-fest"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out sh-color-blue sh-color" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l8WD6IXH540bFtkkBBf4nxkIjJj00A71YUX3uJOaicU/edit?usp=sharing">Proposal Presentation: Pizza DAO Event during Tulum Crypto Fest</a></h3></div><p>We had the pleasure of hearing a compelling proposal from SandRamp, focusing on showcasing Unlock's technology to her community in Tulum during the Crypto Fest. Julien agreed to send Will merchandise and the DAO is considering her sponsorship package, which includes 500UP tokens for distribution and 1k USDC. This initiative could significantly lower the barrier to entry for new users and expand Unlock DAO's reach. The community will have the opportunity to review and vote on this proposal in the coming weeks.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-livestream-la-mudanza"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out sh-color-blue sh-color" href="https://app.unlock-protocol.com/event/unlock-protocol-eventos-la-mudanza">Livestream: La Mudanza</a></h3></div><p>Finally, we are doing a livestream in Spanish with our LATAM communities.

Join us this Wednesday 27th, at 2 PM EST to learn how Unlock DAO moved from Ethereum to Base and how LATAM communities have been using Unlock! Also, there is going to be an exciting raffle!

The call was very productive, and alignment is a given. I was asked to provide a few possible use cases of what integrations could look like, which I did this week. These discussions are still in the early stages, but the potential for meaningful collaboration is exciting. I will keep you posted!</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-introducing-the-advent-calendar-2024"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out sh-color-blue sh-color" href="https://discord.com/channels/462280183425138719/1307105944991174768">Introducing the Advent Calendar 2024</a></h3></div><p>Get ready for a month of surprises and community engagement!
