Unlock Labs is committed to ensuring that Unlock Protocol is accessible across a range of blockchain networks to meet the diverse needs of developers. 

Today, we are happy to announce that the Unlock Protocol has been deployed to the [Linea](https://linea.build) network, effective immediately.

## Why deploy on Linea?

Linea is a developer-ready zkEVM roll-up platform designed for scaling Ethereum decentralized applications (dapps). It provides low gas fees and low latency with high throughput while maintaining the security of Ethereum. 

Linea supports popular development tools and infrastructure, enabling seamless MetaMask distribution and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence.
