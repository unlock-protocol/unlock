The team has been hard at work, and their efforts are bearing fruit. A major highlight is the current airdrop, set to reward approximately 11,000 addresses. This initiative aims to recognize and incentivize users who have actively engaged with the protocol over the past year. The airdrop's criteria are diverse, encompassing paid and free events that utilized Unlock, as well as specific integrations like the impressive work done by our friends at Hats Protocol. Julien emphasized that this is just the second in what they hope will be a series of airdrops, with plans for a third already in motion. The goal is clear: to reward and empower those who have contributed to the Unlock ecosystem, whether through direct usage, governance participation, or integration efforts. This airdrop not only serves as a token of appreciation but also as a strategic move to further decentralize control and engage our community more deeply in the protocol's future.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-eth-denver-recap-a-whirlwind-of-connections-and-innovations">ETH Denver Recap: A Whirlwind of Connections and Innovations</h2></div><p>Our presence at ETH Denver was nothing short of spectacular, with multiple events showcasing the power and versatility of Unlock Protocol.
