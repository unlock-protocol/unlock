*update this* Whenever we get the call to step into the ETHGlobal Hackathons, our team gets almost giddy at the possibilities. Of course, we have our visions for deploying Unlock in ALL the places, but we love to see the innovation and creativity that flows from the hackers participating in these events. Such collaborations from a decentralized viewpoint really do show what’s possible with this ground-breaking technology.

As a sponsor for the NFTHack 2022, we were able to participate in the judging of these projects and saw all the big visions of these innovators, and were truly inspired. Below are the winners and top projects that deployed the protocol to power their creations. Be sure to visit their showcase pages, linked in each description, and see how the project was made. Many of the projects also have links to their Github so you can get a deeper look at the tech behind their work.


## First Prize Winner — Smart Coupons

**Description:** This project is a frontend + plugin into the Salesforce (SFDC) ecosystem to manage Web3-based marketing campaigns to enable an on-ramp for web2 companies to engage their communities within their existing marketing toolset. Our frontend is a sample implementation of how a client (in this case Adidas) would implement the solution. Within their existing web2 channels, the client would offer gamified incentives for users to connect their wallet details. After connecting their wallet, the users would be able to complete additional data enrichment challenges to earn Web3-based rewards. These rewards would be generated from SFDC directly based on specified campaign goals. Once the wallet data is within Salesforce, we enrich the database with on-chain information, tied to the individual lead profile created for the user. This enables a more robust view of the customer, with the ability to create insights and make more informed decisions about campaign targeting.

## Second Prize Winner — HNDSHK

**Description:** HNDSHK allows you to instantly connect and nourish irreplaceable relationships through NFT handshake cards which you can create, manage, and SHK. Exchanging cards is done instantly through NFC tap (HNDSHK). And when you HNDSHK, you also connect on mutual social handles and a POAP is minted which further documents the occasion. Since NFC taps can only be done in person, HNDSHK encourages in-person interactions. In contrast to popular Social Media platforms which are often attention grabs or races to build a following, HNDSHK incentives quality over quantity connections. This is done through a gamified experience - card rarity upgrades, personal card benefits, and reach-out reminders.

## Third Prize Winner — Alexandria

**Description:** This project allows users to borrow an access NFT that gives them access to view a book through our site. The contract allows anyone to borrow a book for however long they like (as long as you can pay the fee). Whilst giving authors royalties on their payments. We allow authors to make sure they get paid for each time their book gets read. The NFT also acts as a way for you to know all the previous borrowers of your book. Once you run out of collateral on your borrow, the NFT gets automatically transferred back to the marketplace via a liquidation function anyone can call.
