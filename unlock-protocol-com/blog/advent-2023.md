[Last year](/blog/advent-calendar-2022), we [gifted over 200,000 NFTs](/blog/advent-infographic) to the Unlock Locksmith community as part of the Advent calendar festivities. This year, we're taking it up a notch! Each day from December 1st to 24th, open a new door on our digital calendar to claim exclusive NFTs, engage in unique experiences, and uncover special surprises.

What makes this year's calendar even more exciting are our collabs with leading names in the Web3 world: [#BuildOnBase](https://base.org/), [Privy](https://privy.io/), [Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/), [Coinage](https://www.coinage.media/), and many others. Each day is a new NFT drop with a blend of insights, fun facts, and special rewards you won't want to miss.

## Features of the 2023 Unlock Protocol Advent Calendar:

- **Unique Daily NFTs**: A new NFT every day created by artist and designer [Chiali Tsai](https://chialitsai.com/), each with its own story and design.

- **Exclusive Content**: Collaborations with Decrypt, Coinage, Privy, and others bring you the best of the Web3 world.

- **Easy Minting**: Thanks to our deployment on Base, minting is easy and virtually cost-free.

- **Surprise Rewards**: Special giveaways and bonuses hidden throughout the month.
