One incredibly powerful thing about using Unlock is that one key can access anything that's behind a lock it has access to. That means you can place the same lock in multiple places or even use it for different purposes (as we did) and let a user who as that one key access everything. So what did we do?

We sold tickets to the NFT Dev Meetup during NYC Blockchain Week through [our ticket app](https://tickets.unlock-protocol.com/event/0x5865Ff2CBd045Ef1cfE19739df19E83B32b783b4) (still in beta) and then allowed ticket holders to also access [the livestream of the event](https://unlock-protocol.com/blog/nft-dev-meetup/).

Without Unlock, complicated. With Unlock piece of cake.

We created a lock on the Unlock dashboard …

 We used that lock to create a ticket page …

… and then used the embed code from that same lock on [the event blog post](https://unlock-protocol.com/blog/nft-dev-meetup/).

Checkout the [tickets page](https://tickets.unlock-protocol.com/event/0x5865Ff2CBd045Ef1cfE19739df19E83B32b783b4) and [the locked blog post](https://unlock-protocol.com/blog/nft-dev-meetup/) with the event video. Want to really try it out? You can still buy a ticket to unlock the video (disclaimer: the sound isn’t great  – and it mostly serves as proof of concept for locking the page).
