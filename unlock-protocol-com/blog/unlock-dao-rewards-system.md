<p>Until recently, Unlock DAO contributors had to rely on their popularity among fellow DAO members to receive a monthly recognition in the form of retroQF (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://paragraph.com/@the-alana-project/web3-grants-explained?referrer=0xD2BC5cb641aE6f7A880c3dD5Aee0450b5210BE23">retro quadratic funding</a>) with our native governance token $UP. Often, the DAO members who were most frequently seen or known received the largest portion of that funding, while the newer or more introverted ones who put in the same or even more work received significantly less. </p><p>We want DAO members to be recognized fairly for contributing value to the community and beyond, particularly in <strong>creating social media content</strong>. After <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cecilia-contreras-castro/">Ceci</a> got elected as our Steward for Marketing and Communications, I decided to sit down and invent a new system. After designing it, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-torbet/">WillT</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wonderwomancode/">Wonderwomancode</a>, among the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://charmverse.io/">Charmverse</a> team, were a great help in translating it into a workable system within our collaborative space. </p><p>Let me break it down so you have a chance to re-design how your contributors get rewarded, or start actively contributing to Unlock DAO.</p><br><h2 id="h-who-is-it-for" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0">Who Is It for?</h2><p>Simply put, this first milestone of building out our contribution systems is designed for content creators and creatives, meaning individuals who enjoy sharing information about Unlock Protocol, explaining how it works, and why it matters to developers, creators, and community organizers.</p><p>Specifically, it is directed towards writers who want to contribute to this newsletter, meme creators who find Unlock inspiring, video creators who love sharing their opinions, and everyone else who feels moved by reading this. </p><br><h2 id="h-how-does-it-work" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0">How Does It Work?</h2><p>There is a recommended pipeline, as we are both a protocol and a social DAO at the same time. As some of you may already know, our organizational structure is based on roles, with stewards assigned to our various working groups. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cecilia-contreras-castro/">Ceci</a> is our Steward for Marketing and Communications and, therefore, your recommended point of contact. Here is the ideal way of getting started:</p><ol><li><p>Join <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://discord.gg/v8wFYQ6DVu">our Discord</a> and mint your free membership NFT by sending the command /unlock in the lobby channel. Mint the NFT and don't forget to hit "Back to Discord" at the end of the process. </p></li><li><p>Look for the working group channel <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://discord.gg/K5GJfkhcq7">#marketing-and-communications</a> and tag Ceci (cecisakura) with a notice of who you are and what you wish to contribute. She can guide you and ensure the beginnings of our new reward system are well-coordinated (until it runs smoothly on its own).</p></li><li><p>Whatever you decide to do, work it out and submit it via our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://app.charmverse.io/join?domain=unlock-dao">Charmverse</a> collaborative space. This is where Ceci can review, comment, and approve. Make sure you use the same wallet you minted the membership NFT with for Discord so you can access it with ease after creating your profile.</p></li><li><p>If you need additional or branded graphics, please tag me (stellaachenbach) in the marketing channel at some point and let me know what you are looking for. I will help you out. </p></li><li><p>At the end of each month, Ceci will finalize calculations, and Andreu will upload the calculated contributions paid in our native governance token, $UP, to our voting platform. If successfully voted on, the amounts will be automatically released about 2 weeks later.</p></li></ol><p>Here is a complete video walkthrough on how to submit your work to our collaborative <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://app.charmverse.io/join?domain=unlock-dao">Charmverse</a> space:</p><div data-type="youtube" videoid="HJxPPkzA_xA">

This means that every video or article you write for us will not only be incentivized with $UP tokens, but our platform will also become yours. Your name will be featured on the publication as prominently as ours.</p><p><strong>We want to grow alongside our creators, not apart from them.</strong></p><br><h2 id="h-thank-you-to-our-guinea-pigs" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0">Thank You To Our Guinea Pigs</h2><p>Thanks to our guinea pigs for the first round: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tagcamila/">Soho</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalu-vincent-704896192/">Gozman</a>!
