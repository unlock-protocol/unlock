We were happy to participate in
[Gitcoin's Grants Round 15](https://gitcoin.co/grants/) as a sponsor of a $25k
pool for the greater Unlock ecosystem and another $10k added to the larger DEI
pool! There are some really exciting numbers to share about what we saw this
round. Gitcoin distributed $4.2 million dollars in funding and saw contributions
from 39.6k community donors. Unlock Protocol doubled the number of grantees in
our ecosystem going from 14 to 28.

Not only were we excited to see the number of grant applications increase in our
ecosystem we were really excited to see the diversity in the types of initiatives
tagging us in.

## Climate Change

We're sure that launching Unlock Protocol on the [Celo](https://celo.org/)
network is why we saw many more projects this round focused on climate change.
[Bloom Network](https://bloomnetwork.org/) continues to be the most well
supported project in both climate change and in the entire ecosystem. So far
they've raised more than $81k through Gitcoin Grants and we're so glad to see the
progress they've made with that funding. Some other projects with great potential
for climate impact are [Green Academy](https://green-academy.webflow.io/),
[Plants & Pillars](https://www.plantsandpillars3.com/),
[dMeter](https://dmeter.super.site/) and [Foresta](https://foresta.live/).

## DeSci

Some impressive projects leveraging Unlock Protocol for decentralized science,
or DeSci, tagged us in this round.
[Omni Analytics](https://twitter.com/omnianalytics) maintaining the top spot for
community support in this category, has continued to use the funding they've
recieved by adding more content to their "Learning Data Science on the Ethereum
Blockchain" course. Congratulations to
[Active Inference Institute](https://www.activeinference.org/) who caught
community attention with their plans to create a first of its kind open-source
package Active Blockference which aims to implement Active Inference simulations
for congnitive modeling for the blockchain space, use Active Blockference to
understand behavior in ETH/Web3 ecosystems and improve educational materials
around use of Active Blockference.

## web3 Social

We saw an increase in the number of web3 social projects taking advantage of
the power of Unlock Protocol too! [Nimi](https://nimi.io/) was a crowd favorite
with a dApp that allows you to aggregate your soical profiles. Other notable
projects include [Cobogo](https://cobogo.io) for creator profiles and
fundraising for the creator economy, [Maven Foundation](https://maven.foundation/)
is continuing their work on building tools to empower social influencers and
[MeTag](https://www.getmetag.io) is creating a scannable QR tag which is also NFC
enabled to help users share their web3 wallet information and social profiles.
[Headline](https://viaheadline.xyz/) a decentrailized publishing platform which
got its start with a [UDT Grant](https://docs.unlock-protocol.com/governance/grants-bounties-and-matchings) from Unlock Protocol jumped onto the Gitcoin
platform this round to continue their work.

## Education & Security

[VestLab](VestLab.io) is aiming to get you all the information about a crypto
project before you invest. [White Hat DAO](https://whitehatdao.com) is
looking to give deeper insights on blockchain projects with offerings that
include smart contract audits, safety ratings along with tokenomics analysis and
due-diligence. [Fractionalize](https://www.amwwaldorf.org) is implementing a
first-of-its-kind public education program to teach kids about web3 and NFTs and
the [Decentralized Library](https://decentralized-library.vercel.app/) will
include Unlock NFT library cards along with reading rewards stored in Unlock
NFTs for "proof of knowledge".

## Unicorns

We also some projects so unique we're daring to call theme unicorns.
[Trust Finance](https://www.trustfin.xyz) is looking to solve some challenges in
the traditional payroll and contractor payments space like slow posting times
and by making it easier for workers to invest a portion of their paychecks.
[Starksheet](https://www.starksheet.xyz/) is hoping to tackle some the largest
data silos by decentralizing business intelligence with a web3 spreadsheet
solution making use of Unlock NFTs.

## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

Last but not least there were several projects both utilizing Unlock Protocol
and tackling Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) in web3. We continue to be
passionate about our support of these projects and we're so enthusiastic to see
so many in this round. Our friends over at [Blu3 DAO](https://www.blu3dao.com/)
continue to do such impressive work educating, preparing and sponsoring hackers
in the web3 space. The community seems to agree with our take on the work they
do, with hundreds of supporters and thousands of dollars in community support.
They were able to raise close to $60k this round with matching funds and we
couldn't be happier to see that happen for them!
[End Domestic Violence](https://EndDomesticViolence.Art) is on a mission to
create a powerful healing modality for domestic violence victims using art to
process trauma and is building an art workshop platform on Unlock Protocol to
deliver it. They continue to be the only grantee on the platform addressing the
issue of domestic violence so we're watching closely to see how the community
reacts to the progess they'll make between this round and next as they get off
the ground. Another project supporting women's reproductive rights while also
bringing you an innovative music experience is
[Beats Per Mint](https://tell.ie/beatspermint/j6upJTcHktEE) who will soon be
releasing their first collection _"Beam Me Down"_ and we couldn't be more
delighted to be enabling a truly feminist platform.
