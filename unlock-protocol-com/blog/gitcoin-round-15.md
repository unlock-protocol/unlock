We were happy to participate in 
[Gitcoin's Grants Round 15](https://gitcoin.co/grants/) as a sponsor of a $25k 
pool for the greater Unlock ecosystem and another $10k added to the larger DEI 
pool! There are some really exciting numbers to share about what we saw this 
round. Gitcoin distributed $4.2 million dollars in funding and saw contributions 
from 39.6k community donors. Unlock Protocol doubled the number of grantees in 
our ecosystem going from 14 to 28.

Not only were we excited to see the number of grant applications increase in our
ecosystem we were really excited to see the diversity in the types of initiatives 
tagging us in. 

## Climate Change
We're sure that launching Unlock Protocol on the [Celo](https://celo.org/) 
network is why we saw many more projects this round focused on climate change. 
[Bloom Network](https://bloomnetwork.org/) continues to be the most well 
supported project in both climate change and in the entire ecosystem. So far 
they've raised more than $81k through Gitcoin Grants and we're so glad to see the 
progress they've made with that funding. Some other projects with great potential 
for climate impact are [Green Academy](https://green-academy.webflow.io/), 
[Plants & Pillars](https://www.plantsandpillars3.com/), 
[dMeter](https://dmeter.super.site/) and [Foresta](https://foresta.live/).

## DeSci

Some impressive projects leveraging Unlock Protocol for decentrailized science, 
or DeSci, tagged us in this round. 
[Omni Analytics](https://twitter.com/omnianalytics) maintaining the top spot for 
community support in this category, has continued to use the funding they've 
recieved by adding more content to their "Learning Data Science on the Ethereum 
Blockchain" course. Congratulations to 
[Active Inference Institute](https://www.activeinference.org/) who caught 
community attention with their plans to create a first of its kind open-source 
package Active Blockference which aims to implement Active Inference simulations 
for congnitive modeling for the blockchain space, use Active Blockference to 
understand behavior in ETH/Web3 ecosystems and improve educational materials 
around use of Active Blockference. 

## web3 Social

We saw an increase in the number of web3 social projects taking advantage of 
the power of Unlock Protocol too! [Nimi](https://nimi.io/) was a crowd favorite 
with a dApp that allows you to aggregate your soical profiles. Other notable 
projects include [Cobogo](https://cobogo.io) for creator profiles and 
fundraising for the creator economy, [Maven Foundation](https://maven.foundation/) 
is continuing their work on building tools to empower social influencers and 
[MeTag](https://www.getmetag.io) is creating a scannable QR tag which is also NFC 
enabled to help users share their web3 wallet information and social profiles. 
[Headline](https://viaheadline.xyz/) a decentrailized publishing platform which 
got its start with a [UDT Grant](https://docs.unlock-protocol.com/governance/grants-bounties-and-matchings) from Unlock Protocol jumped onto the Gitcoin 
platform this round to continue their work.

## Education & Security

[VestLab](VestLab.io) is aiming to get you all the information about a crypto 
project before you invest. [White Hat DAO](https://whitehatdao.com) is 
looking to give deeper insights on blockchain projects with offerings that 
include smart contract audits, safety ratings along with tokenomics analysis and 
due-diligence. [Fractionalize](https://www.amwwaldorf.org) is implementing a 
first-of-its-kind public education program to teach kids about web3 and NFTs and 
the [Decentralized Library](https://decentralized-library.vercel.app/) will 
include Unlock NFT library cards along with reading rewards stored in Unlock 
NFTs for "proof of knowledge". 

## Unicorns

We also some projects so unique we're daring to call theme unicorns. 
[Trust Finance](https://www.trustfin.xyz) is looking to solve some challenges in 
the traditional payroll and contractor payments space like slow posting times 
and by making it easier for workers to invest a portion of their paychecks. 
[Starksheet](https://www.starksheet.xyz/) is hoping to tackle some the largest 
data silos by decentralizing business intelligence with a web3 spreadsheet 
solution making use of Unlock NFTs.

## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

Last but not least there were several projects both utilizing Unlock Protocol 
and tackling Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) in web3. We continue to be 
passionate about our support of these projects and we're so enthusiastic to see 
so many in this round. Our friends over at [Blu3 DAO](https://www.blu3dao.com/) 
continue to do such impressive work educating, preparing and sponsoring hackers 
in the web3 space. The community seems to agree with our take on the work they 
do, with hundreds of supporters and thousands of dollars in community support. 
They were able to raise close to $60k this round with matching funds and we 
couldn't be happier to see that happen for them!
[End Domestic Violence](https://EndDomesticViolence.Art) is on a mission to 
create a powerful healing modality for domestic violence victims using art to 
process trauma and is building an art workshop platform on Unlock Protocol to 
deliver it. They continue to be the only grantee on the platform addressing the 
issue of domestic violence so we're watching closely to see how the community 
reacts to the progess they'll make between this round and next as they get off 
the ground. Another project supporting women's reproductive rights while also 
bringing you an innovative music experience is 
[Beam Per Mint](https://tell.ie/beatspermint/j6upJTcHktEE) who will soon be 
releasing their first collection *"Beam Me Down"* and we couldn't be more 
delighted to be enabling a truly feminist platform.
