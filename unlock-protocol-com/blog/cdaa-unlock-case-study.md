The Certified Digital Asset Advisor (CDAA) designation is the only community-owned designation in the financial services industry. To earn the CDAA designation, financial advisors go through in-depth training and education in the core concepts of cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and decentralized finance. This knowledge enables certified advisors to provide their investor clients with an elevated level of service and education related to cryptoassets.

Once a financial advisor completes the required coursework and passes a rigorous final exam, they receive the CDAA Certification Token. CDAA is an on-chain, NFT-based professional credential, powered by Unlock Protocol, that provably shows the advisor has achieved this distinction.
