<p>The Unlock Labs team has been hard at work adding new capabilities to the core Unlock Protocol smart contracts. This upgrade includes improved mechanics for protocol economics driven by network rewards and subscription renewals.</p><p>Additionally, there are several improvements in existing features, gas optimizations and bug fixes.</p><p>The new Unlock version (v14) and PublicLock version (v15) will be released using a cross-chain DAO proposal in the coming weeks that, once passed, will deploy the upgrade on multiple chains at once.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-whats-in-this-update">What’s in this update</h2></div><p>There are two significant upgrades in this release focused on economics:</p><ul><li><p>A significant improvement to the governance token rewards mechanic for lock managers and projects that deploy paid memberships, paid subscriptions, and paid events</p></li><li><p>Major improvements to the referrer (affiliate) rewards approach and economics included in the protocol around subscription renewals</p></li></ul><p>We’ll look at each of these in more detail.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-governance-token-rewards-are-now-aligned-with-an-l2-driven-world">Governance token rewards are now aligned with an L2-driven world</h2></div><p>When Unlock Protocol was initially created, there was only one network — Ethereum mainnet.</p><p>To balance the competing requirements of incentivizing protocol usage and to address the reality that some actors would want to try to “game” those rewards, the value of a protocol governance reward for any particular transaction was capped by gas. In other words, the maximum reward that could be earned from a single transaction was capped at the gas fee for that same transaction.</p><p>This was to ensure that someone “buying memberships for themselves” couldn’t trigger an infinite money glitch, by acting as both buyer and seller on a transaction with a net-zero cost, and making money off the protocol reward.</p><p>At the time, this design decision was rational, because an actor trying to trigger an infinite money glitch in this manner would spend just as much on gas on mainnet to send the transaction as they were receiving in protocol rewards. In a single-chain, Ethereum-mainnet-only world, this design made sense, and it worked.</p><p>The landscape has changed since then. Most transactions now happen across the abundance of L2s where Unlock Protocol is deployed, including Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, and many others. One trait all these L2s have in common is extremely low gas fees. As such, the economic incentive for deploying Unlock Protocol contracts was reduced if the size of the reward was capped by gas fees paid, since the maximum governance token reward is now capped at pennies or sub-pennies per transaction, since gas fees are so low across these L2s.</p><p>To increase incentives and align the protocol governance rewards with the current economics of these networks, the proposed change in this update is instead to cap the governance reward for paid, deployed contracts at <em>half the protocol reward</em> of the protocol itself, rather than capping it at the gas spent for the transaction.</p><p>(Today, the protocol reward that gets paid back to the Unlock Protocol DAO itself is set to 1% of any transaction value. With this proposed update, the governance token reward to a referrer would therefore be set to 0.5%, half of the protocol reward that goes to the Unlock DAO.)</p><p>Compared to the prior economics, this change has the potential to greatly increase the governance rewards to those building on or referring others to the protocol.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-referrers-affiliates-are-rewarded-more-and-more-often">Referrers (affiliates) are rewarded more, and more often</h2></div><p>The other main economic updates in this release center around how referrer / affiliate rewards are paid out. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover" href="https://unlock-protocol.com/blog/referral-fees">Unlock Protocol has had built-in referral and affiliate reward payouts since 2022</a>.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-referrer-rewards-for-both-affiliates-and-protocol-referrers">Referrer rewards for both affiliates and protocol referrers</h3></div><p>Referrer rewards in this version of the protocol are now two-fold.</p><ul><li><p>An <em>affiliate referrer</em> that will get paid a fraction of the price of each key sold (like an affiliate program)</p></li><li><p>A (possibly different) <em>protocol referrer </em>will be rewarded with UP tokens for using the protocol.</p></li></ul><p>Prior to this upgrade, both were paid to a single address. Now, one can specify an address for the affiliate reward and another address for the governance protocol reward.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-rewards-for-recurring-subscription-purchases">Rewards for recurring subscription purchases</h3></div><p>In prior versions of the protocol, a referrer / affiliate was only paid on the initial purchase of a membership or subscription.
