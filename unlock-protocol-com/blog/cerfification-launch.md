Unlock has launched an easy way to issue certifications and credentials on-chain. Every certification held is a proof of a course completion and has its own verifiable NFT.

Let's see how to create a certification or credential and distribute it to participants.

## Certifications powered by Unlock Protocol

First, visit [https://certifications.unlock-protocol.com](https://certifications.unlock-protocol.com), where you can learn about the benefits of certification and credentialing NFTs powered by Unlock Protocol.

## Enter information about your certification

Click "Create your certification now” to go to the form to build your certification. You’ll put in a few pieces of information to set up your certification.

### Basic certification information

Enter the basic information for your certification including:

- **Certification name**: The program or course name that was completed by the recipient of the certification.
- **Description**: The description for the certification. This will be part of the NFT metadata.
- **Official issuer name**: This is the name of the issuing organization for this certification. This is part of NFT metadata.
- **External URL**: Include a link to the URL of the organization that performed the certification. This will be included in the NFT metadata.
- **Image**: The main image logo that will be shown for the on-chain certificate NFT.
- **Certification duration:** How long the certification will be valid for. Certifications have an unlimited duration by default. This duration can be changed during setup to whatever timeframe is appropriate for your situation.

### Price and quantity

By default, your certification can't be purchased: it can only be granted (”airdropped”) to a recipient. (We’ll explore how to perform the airdrop later in this article.)

In case you do choose to make your certification purchasable, you will need to set a price and a maximum supply of certifications.

### Network

This is the network on which your certification smart contract will be deployed.

Once the above settings are specified, you can deploy the certificate and see the preview.

## Certificate overview

Each certification has a dedicated page where information for that certification is visible.

An individual who holds a certificate will be able to download it or share it via social networks.

### Certification template

### Issued certification

### Transferable certificate

In most cases, a certification should not be able to be transferred to another user. Certifications will be non-transferable by default, and a notification will be shown in the user interface if a certification is able to be transferred. This notification is displayed to help ensure that the ability to transfer certifications is the intention of the creator of the certification program.

## Airdrop

As a [Lock Manager](https://docs.unlock-protocol.com/core-protocol/public-lock/access-control/#lockmanager) and creator of a certification, you can [airdrop](https://unlock-protocol.com/guides/how-to-airdrop-memberships/) certificates to your users either to their crypto wallet address or to their email address.
