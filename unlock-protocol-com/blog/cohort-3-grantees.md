We’re so excited to announce the third cohort of grantees for the Unlock Protocol grant program! Our grant selection committee met at the beginning of September and selected a fabulous range of projects. From Notion integrations, creator portals, DAO support tools, lending protocols and more! The scope of these projects shows us all what’s possible with a little creativity and ingenuity.
