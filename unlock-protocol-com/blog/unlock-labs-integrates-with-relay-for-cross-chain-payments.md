Relay uses “relayers,” which are specialized agents that act on behalf of users, to execute transactions on various chains.</p><p>By using this model, Relay reduces the need for users to bridge assets manually and reduces high transaction fees.</p><p>Relay enables users to complete transactions quickly, usually in just seconds, and keeps costs low by minimizing onchain operations.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-why-relay-matters-for-unlock-protocol">Why Relay matters for Unlock Protocol</h2></div><p>Integrating Relay with the Unlock Labs checkout experience makes cross-chain transactions convenient, fast, and affordable for users. Unlock Protocol focuses on democratizing memberships and subscriptions onchain, and Relay’s features align well with this mission.</p><p>With this integration, creators and builders using Unlock Protocol get:</p><p><strong>Seamless purchase of cross-chain memberships:</strong> Users can use tokens from one chain (e.g. “ETH on mainnet”) to purchase memberships or subscriptions deployed on another chain (e.g. a subscription on Base that’s priced in USDC). The Relay integration eliminates the need to bridge assets manually or take other confusing or time-consuming steps prior to purchase. This reduces friction significantly, and makes the purchase process straightforward for users with varying levels of technical expertise.</p><p><strong>Cost and time savings:</strong> By leveraging Relay’s relayer model, transactions are processed quickly and at a lower cost than other methods such as manual bridging.</p><p><strong>Broad industry and network support: </strong>Relay’s architecture allows Unlock Labs to support a wide range of networks from a single checkout experience. This means that developers and users across different ecosystems can now access Unlock-powered memberships and subscriptions without being concerned with network-specific limitations.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-building-together-in-public">Building together, in public</h2></div><p>The integration highlights the Unlock Protocol community’s ongoing commitment to improving usability and driving onchain adoption.</p><p>By addressing existing pain points such as high costs and complicated cross-chain processes, Unlock Protocol continues to ship real solutions for onchain memberships and subscriptions that are usable by all.</p><p>Relay’s capabilities are solidly aligned with Unlock’s philosophy, and make it easier for developers and users to interact with cross-chain applications in a straightforward manner.</p><p>The Unlock Labs integration with Relay is yet another step towards a more interconnected and accessible approach where interoperability and ease of use are central to the user experience.</p><p></p>
