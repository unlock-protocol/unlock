A few days ago, we introduced [Events By Unlock](/blog/events-launch), the easiest way to create tickets as NFTs and host an events details page for web3 events!

Today, we’re introducing a new feature: the ability to download a Google or Apple pass on your device with our partner [EthPass](https://www.ethpass.xyz/)!

You can easily add the pass to your phone’s wallet through the Unlock Keychain by clicking on any of your NFTs, as long as they have been deployed on one of the supported networks.

Alternatively, you can also add the pass right after you have minted your NFT ticket, on the final confirmation screen!

Attendees can then easily show the pass from their mobile wallet to the organizers on site in order to access the venue!
