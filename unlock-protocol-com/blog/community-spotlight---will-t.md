<p>Did you know that Unlock DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that governs the actual protocol? These are ordinary people, like you, making decisions about the protocol and its future development in a decentralized manner, using the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://docs.unlock-protocol.com/governance/unlock-dao/">$UP token as the governance currency</a>. </p><p>DAO Members propose new ideas through proposals and vote on them to help the protocol be future-proof. However, aside from DAO Members, we also have DAO Contributors, Ambassadors, and Stewards. These members have dedicated additional resources and time to the ever-evolving future of Unlock Protocol.</p><p>Today, we’re shining the spotlight on one of us, a passionate educator and creative builder in the Unlock community: <strong>Will T</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id="h-who-is-will-t" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0">Who is <strong>Will T</strong>?</h2><p>A lot of individuals slow down after retirement, but not Will T.</p><p>After many years of success in Corporate America and a successful business career, he decided to step away in 2020, just about the time the world seemed to stop. While most people were learning to live under lockdown, Will T was opening a new chapter of his life. Curiosity took him straight into the world of blockchain.</p><blockquote><h3 id="h-after-retiring-i-began-to-put-time-into-studying-the-blockchain-ecosystem-around-march-2020-he-said" class="text-2xl font-header !mt-6 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0"><em>"After retiring, I began to put time into studying the blockchain ecosystem around March 2020," he said. </em></h3><h3 id="h-fast-forward-to-today-im-an-education-maxi-and-founder-of-kfmediasm-building-a-model-for-regenerative-learning" class="text-2xl font-header !mt-6 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0"><em>"Fast-forward to today, I'm an education maxi and founder of </em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://x.com/KMLLCW3"><em>KFMEDIA℠</em></a><em>, building a model for regenerative learning."</em></h3></blockquote><p>Will's introduction to Unlock DAO had come via perhaps the most natural avenue possible: conversation. During one of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://x.com/LetsGROWDAO">Let's GROW</a> Live sessions, Stella&nbsp; (Lead Steward for Unlock at the time) dropped in, looking for someone to help onboard and educate individuals about Unlock. Will responded instantly, <em>“Let’s see what this is all about and where I can help.”</em></p><p>The instinct to jump in and contribute is what makes him a valued community member in Unlock.</p><p>Will T describes himself as “more of an ambassador,” and that couldn’t be more fitting. Will doesn’t just represent Unlock in words; he means it in action. He shows up, contributes where it matters, and brings others along with him.</p><p>He is currently bridging the gap between education and onchain tooling, all while sharing ideas of how learning systems can thrive within decentralized communities. He has a patient, people-centered approach: <strong>he builds while teaching and teaches while building</strong>.</p><p>And that's what makes Will T a reflection of Unlock's spirit: an open door, an outstretched hand, and the honest will to help others grow together with him.</p><p>I asked him to describe Unlock in one sentence. He stated without hesitation:</p><blockquote><h3 id="h-one-stop-shop-for-event-ticketing-attendee-management-subscriptions-memberships-and-online-certification" class="text-2xl font-header !mt-6 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0"><em>“One-stop-shop for event ticketing, attendee management, subscriptions, memberships, and online certification.”</em></h3></blockquote><p>It felt simple, straightforward, and honest. In those few words, he captured the essence of Unlock's mission: making onchain access painless for creators and their communities.</p><p>Will says that his time in the DAO has been practical and personal.</p><blockquote><h3 id="h-its-allowed-me-to-understand-more-about-the-product-suite-that-we-can-leverage-within-my-company-and-interaction-with-various-community-members-have-allowed-me-to-unlock-my-creativity" class="text-2xl font-header !mt-6 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0"><em>"It's allowed me to understand more about the product suite that we can leverage within my company, and interaction with various community members have allowed me to unlock my creativity."</em></h3></blockquote><p>This is the kind of spark that keeps the Unlock ecosystem alive, builders learning from builders, learners turning into builders, all under one roof.</p><p>Here is something not so obvious about Will: he is a home chef and has been perfecting his craft for the last fifteen years.</p><p>Whether he's stirring a sauce or developing a learning model, he brings the same patience and precision to the process. Both require balance, timing, and a touch of experimentation, and both end up feeding others in one way or another.</p><hr><h2 id="h-words-for-newcomers" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0"><strong>Words for Newcomers</strong></h2><p>If you’re just stepping into Unlock DAO, Will’s advice is straightforward:</p><blockquote><h3 id="h-find-a-lane-to-swim-in-apply-to-a-working-group-and-take-action-on-what-you-can-influence" class="text-2xl font-header !mt-6 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0"><em>“Find a lane to swim in, apply to a working group, and take action on what you can influence.”</em></h3></blockquote><p>It's practical wisdom from someone who's lived it. Here, progress is not perfection; it's participation.</p><hr><h2 id="h-get-in-touch-with-will-t" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0">Get in Touch with Will T</h2><p>If you’d like to connect, collaborate, or just share ideas about education and onchain communities, you can find Will T here, but most frequently on X:</p><ul><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://x.com/WillTSBUDAO">X</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://farcaster.xyz/kingfishersmedia">Farcaster</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-torbet/">LinkedIn</a></p></li></ul><hr><h2 id="h-until-the-next-key-turns" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0"><strong>Until the next key turns!</strong></h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalu-vincent-704896192/">GozmanGonzalez</a> <br>Your Storyteller Locksmith</p><hr><h2 id="h-want-to-get-spotlighted" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0">Want to get Spotlighted?</h2><p>Are you part of the Unlock Protocol DAO, or have you built something with the protocol?
