<p>Activities are coming onchain, first slowly, then all at once.</p><p>When they do, the flywheel spins and spurs the development of inventive apps and use cases, expanding the onchain ecosystem. This is a Good Thing.</p><p>As it is, the events industry is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover" href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23569504/ticketmaster-monopoly-live-nation-taylor-swift-antitrust-clyde-lawrence">broken</a>. Bringing events and event-related activities onchain has implications for ticketing in particular, where it can help combat counterfeiting, the very broken ticketing aftermarket, and other systemic woes.</p><p>Additionally, bringing events onchain opens up possibilities for creating networks based on these onchain events, with the associated network effects for both organizers and participants.</p><p>Even with these benefits, at ETHDenver 2024, many of the side events still used offchain solutions such as Luma, Eventbrite, and Partiful. For events that haven’t started to come onchain yet, here’s another incentive:</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Unlock Labs will airdrop a pool of 2500 OP tokens to event organizers who retroactively bring their ETHDenver 2024 events onchain.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>Here is how it works.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-how-event-organizers-can-claim-tokens-in-the-unlock-labs-onchain-events-airdrop-1">How event organizers can claim tokens in the Unlock Labs Onchain Events Airdrop 1</h2></div><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-who-is-eligible">Who is eligible</h3></div><p>You are an event organizer who organized an event using Luma, Partiful, or Eventbrite at <strong>ETHDenver 2024</strong>.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-how-to-qualify">How to qualify</h3></div><ul><li><p>You <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover" href="https://unlock-protocol.com/guides/how-to-airdrop-attendance-nfts-for-events-using-luma/"><strong>airdrop onchain Proof of Attendance tokens</strong></a> to your attendees who signed up for your ETHDenver 2024 event <strong><em>(Note: Attendees do NOT need a wallet in order to receive the Proof of Attendance tokens — an email address is all that’s needed for the attendees).</em></strong></p></li><li><p>You fill out an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover" href="https://app.deform.cc/form/644716e7-a788-426b-89ce-4360ab52b1b7/?page_number=0"><strong>airdrop claim application</strong></a> with information about your event, and show that you’ve airdropped the onchain Proof of Attendance tokens to those attendees using Unlock Protocol; your award will be based on the number of Proof of Attendance tokens you airdrop to your past attendees from your ETHDenver 2024 event.</p></li><li><p>Unlock Labs will airdrop OP tokens to the event organizer upon review and approval of the airdrop claim application by April 15th, 2024.</p></li></ul><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-airdrop-amounts">Airdrop amounts</h3></div><p>Airdrops will be given to event organizers who had at least five people sign up for their event at ETHDenver 2024 using Luma, Partiful, or Eventbrite using the following reward levels:</p><ul><li><p><strong>0-4 signups:</strong> No reward</p></li><li><p><strong>5 - 25 signups and confirmed drop of Proof of Attendance (POA) tokens powered by Unlock Protocol:</strong> 25 OP for you, the organizer</p></li><li><p><strong>26-100 signups and POA dropped: </strong>1.5x bonus (38 OP for you, the organizer)</p></li><li><p><strong>101+ signups and POA dropped:</strong> 2x bonus (50 OP for you, the organizer)</p></li></ul><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-where-is-the-claim-form">Where is the claim form?</h3></div><p>The claim form is here:</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://app.deform.cc/form/644716e7-a788-426b-89ce-4360ab52b1b7/?page_number=0">https://app.deform.cc/form/644716e7-a788-426b-89ce-4360ab52b1b7/?page_number=0</a></p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-what-other-benefits-are-there-for-retroactively-bringing-my-event-onchain-and-claiming-my-op-tokens"><strong>What other benefits are there for retroactively bringing my event onchain and claiming my OP tokens?</strong></h3></div><p>We know that Optimism has allocated <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover" href="https://optimism.mirror.xyz/nz5II2tucf3k8tJ76O6HWwvidLB6TLQXszmMnlnhxWU">an additional 850 million OP tokens</a> for future direct airdrops themselves.
