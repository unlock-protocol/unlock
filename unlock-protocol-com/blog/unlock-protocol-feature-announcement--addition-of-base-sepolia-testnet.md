<p>Sepolia is an Ethereum test network (testnet) that developers use to test their applications and smart contracts before deploying them on a production network. Sepolia is a newer testnet compared to others like the now-deprecated Goerli testnet, providing a more up-to-date environment that closely mimics the mainnet. </p><p>Unlock Protocol has supported Sepolia on Ethereum mainnet since its release. </p><p>With this feature release, Unlock Protocol supports Base Sepolia as well.</p>
