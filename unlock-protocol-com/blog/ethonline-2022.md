Unlock Protocol sponsored the [ETHGlobal ETHOnline hackathon](https://online.ethglobal.com/) last month and there were many creative submissions for prizes that we’re excited to tell you about!

First, we’d like to give a shout-out to a number of participating teams we think did a really amazing job. All of these projects were very exciting and interesting use cases for Unlock Protocol.

## Runners-up

- [Subgrounds](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/unlock-protocol-subgrounds-gyhj8) showed us the potential of using Python for doing data analytics against Unlock subgraphs.
- [3toN](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/3ton-ftzq1) built a web3 pay-per-view Dapp using Unlock Protocol for [web3 subscriptions](https://unlock-protocol.com/blog/recurring-subscription-nft).
- [Streamharbour](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/streamharbour-h1uqk) built a tool for streamers to monetize their content, accept donations, and communicate with their fans — and also won prizes from Covalent, XMTP and IPFS.

Now, let's see the Unlock hackathon prize winners!

## Impact Self - 3rd place

The third place prize went to [Impact Self](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/impact-self-n5y5t). Impact Self built a platform for generating an environmental impact score on-chain. The score provides a quantifiable way for individuals to communicate their climate-positive actions and contributes to their sovereign web3 identity.

## Raindrop - 2nd place

The [Raindrop](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/raindrop-omz63) team created a decentralized platform alternative to subscription sites like Patreon or OnlyFans. Raindrop’s approach enables creatives to connect with their fans without the worry of being censored or de-platformed or having to worry about the portability of their user data.

This team won several other prizes during this event including ones from Worldcoin, Livepeer and IPFS.

I think you’ll find that if you choose to build on Unlock Protocol, you’ll see the same thing that Raindrop’s Hidetaka Ko did when he said _“I was impressed that they were quicker and more polite than any other protocol.”_ I’m proud to say we have a supportive and encouraging community, not just the core team but the other people building who give back regularly because they embrace the WAGMI vision.

We hope that the Raindrop team continues their journey building on Unlock Protocol!

## Homebase - 1st place

Our first-prize winner, [Homebase](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/homebase-4kyoh), set out to tackle monetization for creators, a sweet spot for the use of Unlock Protocol. In contrast to Raindrop, Homebase focused on the social aspect and introduced social graph functionality through [Lens Protocol](https://lens.xyz/). In addition to implementing Unlock, Homebase paired with Next.js, The Graph, IPFS and Google Firebase. (Note: Unlock has integrations with [Firebase](https://david-layton.gitbook.io/novum/) and [many other](https://unlock-protocol.com/guides/category/plugins/) existing web2 and web3 tools. Interoperability continues to be a core reason people build on Unlock Protocol.)

Homebase did a beautiful job thinking through the design and flow of their application and it’s certainly the type of social platform I’d like to see more of.

If you’re interested in joining a hackathon where you can get some experience building in web3 on Unlock Protocol, come hack with us at [ETH San Francisco](https://sf.ethglobal.com/)! That said, you don’t need to be at an event to learn from us or ask questions. Join the Unlock Locksmith community by jumping into our [Discord](http://discord.unlock-protocol.com) server, where you’ll find the veteran builders and core team hanging out, answering questions, talking about the future of web3 and just generally supporting each other.
