After Mainnet, Gnosis Chain (nÃ©e xDAI), Polygon, Optimism, Binance, Celo, we're excited to announce that you can deploy your NFT membership contracts on the [Avalanche](https://avax.network/) C-Chain!

> The Contract Chain is the default smart contract blockchain on Avalanche and enables the creation of any Ethereum-compatible smart contracts. This blockchain is for applications that require total ordering (for faster asset transfers or any other commutative application, use the Exchange Chain). The Contract Chain implements the Snowman consensus protocol.

Of course, to do that, you first need to have a few Avax tokens on your wallet
