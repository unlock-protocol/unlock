Today, we’re unveiling a cool new page on our static site: it’s called [“State of Unlock”](https://unlock-protocol.com/state) and shows some important metrics for the Unlock Protocol adoption!

Since we firmly believe in a world where creators will deploy their locks on multiple networks, we show both the aggregate data, as well as data on a per-network basis.

Here are the 3 core metrics we care about:

- **Number of Locks deployed:** That’s the number of smart contracts deployed by creators, brands and teams who want to operate a membership program on chain.
- **Number of Keys sold:** That’s the number of membership NFT sold. It provides a good indication of the penetration of Unlock!
- **Active Locks:** That’s the number of locks that have minted _at least_ one membership NFT in the previous 30 days.

Of course, we also measure the “Gross Network Product” which is the total revenue generated through Unlock on a given network. We can’t easily aggregate these because they are measured in each networks’ base currency (ETH on Ethereum mainnet, MATIC on Polygon… etc).

As a member of the Unlock ecosystem, you are now able to get an overview of the protocol reach and growth.
