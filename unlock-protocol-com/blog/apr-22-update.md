## Dashboard improvements

- **Airdrops to multiple wallets** — Lock managers can now airdrop keys to multiple wallets at one time (huge time saver!)
- **Lock managers can expire memberships** — Lock managers can expire (cancel) memberships right from the dashboard

## Keychain improvements

- **Members can expire memberships** — Similar to the above, members can expire (cancel) memberships right from their keychain


## Checkout improvements

- **Customize recipient** — Purchasers can customize the recipient of the purchase (e.g. when purchasing as a gift)
- **Multiple recipients** — Purchaseers can purchase multiple keys at once
- **CAPTCHA improvements** — Improved CAPTCHA for bot deterrence (especially useful for NFT ticket sales)
- **Extending expired membership (v10)** — Expired memberships can be reactivted from checkout


## Credit card handling improvements

- **Improved page handling** — Improved handling of page refresh to reduce the chance of transactions being submitted multiple times
- **Improved transaction sequencing** — Credit card purchases are now executed only after the blockchain transaction is successful


## Website improvements
