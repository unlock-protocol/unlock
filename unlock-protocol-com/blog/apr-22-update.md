## Keychain improvements

- **Members can expire memberships** — Similar to the above, members can expire (cancel) memberships right from their keychain

## Checkout improvements

- **Multiple recipients** — Purchasers can purchase multiple keys at once

- **Extending expired membership (v10)** — Expired memberships can be reactivated from checkout

## Credit card handling improvements
