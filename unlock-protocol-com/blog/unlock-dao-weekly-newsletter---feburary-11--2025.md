<div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-hey-locksmiths">Hey Locksmiths!</h2></div><p>Welcome to another exciting edition of the Unlock DAO newsletter! We've got a packed update for you this week, fresh from our recent DAO call. Let's dive into the latest developments and initiatives that are shaping the future of our community.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-eth-denver-gearing-up-for-web3s-premier-event">ETH Denver: Gearing Up for Web3's Premier Event</h2></div><p>As ETH Denver approaches, the Unlock DAO community is organizing events with fellow communities and protocols in the space. This year, we're not just attending – we're making waves with a series of engaging events and collaborations. One of the most recent highlights is our possible partnership with Cryptosapiens (check out the idea and deck in the related Discord channel), presented by community member Humpty. This collaboration promises to be another game-changer for our presence at ETH Denver. Humpty's event aims to bridge the gap between crypto-natives and the broader creator community in Denver, offering a space for learning, networking, and showcasing Unlock Protocol's capabilities.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-evolving-our-community-identity-updating-the-culture-guide-nft">Evolving Our Community Identity: Updating the Culture Guide NFT</h2></div><p>In our ongoing efforts to strengthen our community bonds and reflect our evolving identity, we're excited to announce a design update to our Culture Guide NFT (access community NFT). This digital asset serves as a cornerstone of our community, embodying our values and vision. Remember to renew your membership NFT once in a while as it expires after a few months.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-expanding-our-reach-polygon-grants-initiative">Expanding Our Reach: Polygon Grants Initiative</h2></div><p>In an exciting development for Unlock DAO, we're actively pursuing grant opportunities through the Polygon ecosystem. This initiative aligns perfectly with our goal of expanding Unlock Protocol's presence/ visibility across multiple blockchain networks. While many of the available tracks are focused on AI agents, which isn't directly applicable to our core protocol, we're exploring opportunities within the regular track that could significantly benefit Unlock DAO. Wonderwomancode and myself will lead the initiative and are grateful for any prior experiences from fellow Unlock DAO members.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-personalizing-our-roles-update-on-role-nfts-with-leah">Personalizing Our Roles: Update on Role NFTs with Leah</h2></div><p>We're thrilled to share progress on our Role NFTs project, led by the talented Leah Sams. These NFTs are set to revolutionize how we represent and recognize roles within our DAO structure. Leah has been hard at work, investigating in more detail what Unlock Protocol DAO stands for and how these values can be translated visually. She will be back with a cohesive mood board and first ideas shortly. These Role NFTs will serve as visual badges of honor, showcasing member contributions and their position in our ecosystem.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-amplifying-our-voice-ninja-promo-proposal">Amplifying Our Voice: Ninja Promo Proposal</h2></div><p>In our quest to expand Unlock DAO's reach and influence, we're considering a partnership with Ninja Promo. This collaboration could significantly boost our marketing efforts and increase our visibility in the Web3 space. The proposal outlines a possible collaboration between the DAO and the agency and suggests a three-month trial period. We are currently gearing up to get all our analytics rights so we can measure potential impact along multiple parameters. Please review the current Snapshot proposal to cast your vote on it.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-our-newsletter-ethermail-considerations">Our Newsletter: Ethermail Considerations</h2></div><p>As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance community engagement, we're exploring the adoption of Ethermail for our newsletter distribution. This Web3-native email solution offers exciting possibilities for reaching our audience even more targeted. Ethermail's features include email campaigning towards NFT holders, which could be a great opportunity to reach even more holders across our ecosystem. Therefore, we're particularly excited about the potential of integrating our existing NFT-based membership system with Ethermail with more personalized content. Kara from the Si&lt;3&gt; community will keep us posted on her first experiences before we start drafting the idea into a proposal.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-understanding-our-community-user-survey-draft">Understanding Our Community: User Survey Draft</h2></div><p>To better serve our community and guide our future developments, we're preparing a comprehensive user survey thanks to Kara and Ceci. This initiative aims to gather valuable insights into how our members interact with Unlock Protocol, what features they find most valuable, and what improvements they'd like to see.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-empowering-education-siless3greater-open-campus-accelerator-and-grant-certifications">Empowering Education: SI&lt;3&gt; Open Campus Accelerator and Grant Certifications</h2></div><p>We're excited to hear about the SI&lt;3&gt;'s participation in the Open Campus Accelerator program. This initiative presents a unique opportunity also for Unlock DAO to showcase our technology in an educational context and potentially integrate our protocol into the certification processes. We will keep you posted!</p><p>As we wrap up this newsletter, it's clear that Unlock DAO is at the forefront of innovation in the Web3 space now more than ever. From our presence at major events like ETH Denver to our exploration of new technologies and partnerships, we're continuously pushing the boundaries of what's possible with decentralized access control.</p><p>Your active participation in these initiatives is what drives our success. Whether you're contributing ideas, voting on proposals, or spreading the word about Unlock Protocol, every action helps build our vibrant community.</p><p>Stay tuned for more updates, and let's continue to unlock the potential of decentralized technology together!</p><p>Stay Unlocked!<br>Your Lead Steward<br>Stella</p><hr><p><strong>Important links</strong></p><ul><li><p>Check out Unlock Protocol for yourself: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://unlock-protocol.com/">https://unlock-protocol.com/</a></p></li><li><p>Join us for our recurring and unique events: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://app.unlock-protocol.com/events/unlock-dao-events-2025">https://app.unlock-protocol.com/events/unlock-dao-events-2025</a></p></li><li><p>Vote for Unlock DAO Proposals offchain: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://snapshot.box/#/s:unlock-dao.eth￼Vote">https://snapshot.box/#/s:unlock-dao.eth</a></p></li><li><p>Vote for Unlock DAO Proposals onchain: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://www.tally.xyz/gov/unlock-protocol">https://www.tally.xyz/gov/unlock-protocol</a></p></li><li><p>Join the Unlock DAO Collaborative space on Charmverse: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://app.charmverse.io/join?domain=unlock-dao">https://app.charmverse.io/join?domain=unlock-dao</a></p></li></ul><p></p>
