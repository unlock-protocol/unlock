**Mintgate & Unlock Integration**

Expanding the reach and usability of the Unlock Protocol by integrating with [Mintgate](https://www.mintgate.io/) will help support the thriving community of creators running membership platforms. [Jennifer Tran](https://medium.com/@jennifer.trincoll), a co-founder of Mintgate, submitted a proposal to create an integration with Unlock that would “allow users to create links and videos that are gated by an Unlock lock and can be assessed through an Unlock key.”

Essentially, this Mintgate integration will allow their users to now offer memberships through NFT tokens. Expanding the ability for creators to both control and monetize their content and communities will propel us all towards a decentralized web reality even faster!

**Why This Project?**

> Supporting and empowering the creator ecosystem is important for the future of the web. We decided on this project because MintGate has created a great service for creatives that want to quickly token gate their content. Being able to empower MintGate with our platform helps empower all ecosystems. We’re excited to have this partnership together. We believe it is a great mix of strengths and that it can help both teams reach more people.

**Looking Forward**

We’re excited to have such an insightful project in our grant program and are wishing Jennifer and her team all the best as they build this powerful integration for the Web3 world!
