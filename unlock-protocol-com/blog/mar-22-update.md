## Governance items

And there are a *huge* number of March 2022 product updates from Unlock! The team delivered a number of new features this month that include...

## In production

- **Notification toasts in Dashboard** - Added toaster notifications throughout the Unlock interface for communicating status
- **Captcha on checkout flow bot prevention measure** - Deter bots from purchasing NFT tickets in a scripted manner
- **Support for password-protected checkout** - Our checkout flow now supports a “password” flow where a lock manager can set a hook on their contract so that purchasing keys only works if the user enters a password in the checkout flow
- **Support for unlimited duration in Dashboard and Keychain** - Enable lock managers to set unlimited key duration directly from the dashboard
- **Changing number of keys on Dashboard** - Enable lock managers to update maximum keys directly from dashboard
- **Whole new static site** - Completely redesigned https://www.unlock-protocol.com
- **Skipping metadata collection when all fields are optional** - Enable a purchaser to skip optional metadata collection during checkout
- **Redesigned Keychain** - Redesigned look and feel for the Keychain page, including links to OpenSea for every key
- **Attachment in emails** - You can now set attachments for email being sent on key purchases
- **Customizable recipient on checkout** - It is now possible upon checkout to customize the address of the wallet that will receive the NFT membership, so a purchaser can buy a membership for someone else.
- **Easier checkout flow** - Based on community feedback, we continue to deploy redesigned and improved checkout experiences throughout Unlock

## Coming soon

- **Multiple key ownership in smart contracts** (Coming in April) - Enable wallets to hold more than one key/membership at a time
- **Mimic “Ownable” in smart contracts** (Coming in April) - Enable lock managers to show ownership of locks; aids in situations like OpenSea metadata management
- **Create Lock in specific version** (Coming in April) - Enables a lock manager to choose which version of the lock contract to use

## Developer improvements

- **Refactored unlock-express** - unlock-express now to use Passport (Node.js's most used authentication framework)
