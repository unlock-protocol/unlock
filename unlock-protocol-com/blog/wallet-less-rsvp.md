Earlier this year we announced a feature we called [wallet-less airdrops](http://localhost:3002/blog/email-recipient). We realized that too many web3 experiences required users to first go through too many complicated steps before they could start enjoying the fun experiences web3 provides. So we introduced wallet-less airdrops, through which users receive an NFT *before* they actually configure a wallet.

Similarly, a few weeks ago, we announced our [web3 event hosting application](http://localhost:3002/blog/events-launch)! It was used by a dozen events at [ETHDenver](http://localhost:3002/blog/ethdenver2023), from DIDDay, to a very cool ShakeShack activation!

One of the pieces of feedback we received from several organizers was that they wanted to also make it trivial for non-crypto users to quickly RSVP for their events, provided that these events were indeed free. So today, we're introducing wallet-less RSVP!

You can try it by [registering for this virtual launch party](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/event?lockAddress=0x069d50f18f13426f7ba74bd20ea04c1fc1943c43&network=5)!

We also added the ability to set the end time for events, and added a calendar invite in the confirmation emails! [Get started now](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/event): organize your web3 meetup, crypto party, or other event using Unlock!
