## What is a smart contract audit contest?

Code4rena's contests are not bug bounties — contests have guaranteed payouts for all legit findings.

From Code4rena's site:

**Bug bounties:**
- *Spec work.* No way to have confidence that the time invested will produce a payout.
- *Dark forest.* Who knows how much competition there is right now? Or how mature the codebase is?
- *Grow on your own.* Researchers have to proactively look for ways to learn and level up their skills.
- *Paradox of choice.* So many projects have bounties. How does an auditor choose which to focus on?

vs.

**Audit contests:**
- *Guaranteed payouts.* Auditors know it’s highly likely they can find a bug that will make it worth their time.
- *Low-hanging fruit.* If a project is seeking an audit, it’s likely fresh code with clear opportunities to dig in.
- *Learning community.* Open contests let auditors compare everyone’s findings and learn new things every single week.
- *No FOMO.* C4 runs a handful of active contests at a time—often just one or two, tops.


## Very interesting — how do I participate?
