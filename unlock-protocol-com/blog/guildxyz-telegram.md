Earlier this month, we showed you [how to token-gate a Discord server](/blog/guildxyz-launch) using Unlock and Guild.xyz.

Today, we'll show you how to token-gate a Telegram chat with Unlock as well.

First, add the Guild bot (@guildxyz_bot) to your Telegram chat.

Then, in Telegram, configure settings to allow the Guild bot to manage the chat.

Adjust the chat settings (set to Public, add a name, click "Done," then set back to Private and click "Done").

Set the Guild bot as an admin on the chat.

In Guild, set up the token gate using an Unlock lock. (You can set up an lock from the Unlock dashboard.)

That's it! You now have a token-gated Telegram chat.
