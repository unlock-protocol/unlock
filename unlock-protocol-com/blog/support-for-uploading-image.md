![Metadata Editor](/images/blog/support-for-uploading-images/image_upload.png)

We're excited to announce support for uploading images in the metadata editor. This will make it easier for you to build rich NFT collections by uploading images in advance before minting. If you want to learn more about how to use the metadata editor, check out our earlier [post](https://unlock-protocol.com/blog/key-metadata-configurator).

For those who still want to host their image collection using services like Pinata, you can provide the image URL in the metadata editor.
