Here at Unlock, we've been working hard at pushing out new features to the protocol, integrations, plug-ins, and tooling. We thought it was finally time the docs got some upgrades too. Let's take a look at precisely what's changed!

First, we moved the [guides](https://unlock-protocol.com/guides/) out to a different section of our website and ensured those things that spoke directly to creators were in a single spot. You'll find them linked from the home page.

What we left in our [docs](https://docs.unlock-protocol.com/) were all those things relevant to developers, which is why you'll now find them linked from the home page under "Devs", along with some handy shortcuts to commonly used spots you may want to drop right into such as the API Reference or one of our many tools.

Something we were super excited to be able to do with this upgrade is to start generating core protocol references directly from our protocol repository, ensuring that we are constantly keeping the docs up to date with releases to protocol.

In addition to that, we've included some features that make them much more user-friendly, including;

- Better search
- Improved navigation
- light / dark modes
- accessibility: high contrast, code sample blocks

All of these enhancements are just the beginning! We're still working to bring you the best experience possible and are dedicated to regularly releasing more tutorials on specific use cases, integrations, application architecture, and more. We'll be adding more to the "Tools" we've built for developers to use when implementing the protocol. You'll see more development of "New to web3?" for those developers who need a better understanding of the web3 ecosystem as they onboard from web2.

We're excited to be here to serve our open source community, and we welcome contributions. You'll find our docs repository on [github](https://github.com/unlock-protocol/docs) with instructions on how to contribute. If you see a place we can improve, please enter an issue or a pull request, and since our DAO governance has mechanisms for giving back to those who make contributions, your efforts won't go unrewarded.
