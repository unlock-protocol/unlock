<p>Building on last month’s announcement of integration with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://unlock-protocol.com/blog/unlock-labs-integrates-coinbase-wallet-as-a-service-for-embedded-wallets">Coinbase Wallet as a Service</a>, Unlock Labs has added a new email login flow, which gives users another intuitive way to access their Unlock account. This update is one of a number significant enhancements in the app's authentication options, and adds on the previous option to login using a Google account or self-custodied wallet. </p><p>The new email login flow allows users to sign in using any email address.</p><p>The process is straightforward: a user enters an email address, receives a verification code in their email inbox, and uses that code to log in a Unlock Labs app.</p><div data-type="youtube" videoid="Rt04M8rV_UA">

After logging out, users can easily log back in using their email using the same process. This ensures that even if a user decides to disconnect their Google account, they can still access their Unlock account seamlessly through their email address.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-integration-with-coinbase-wallet-as-a-service">Integration with Coinbase Wallet as a Service</h2></div><p>One of the standout aspects of this new feature is its integration with Coinbase Wallet as a Service infrastructure. When logging in with a Google account or an email address, Unlock Labs sets up an embedded wallet linked to the user's email address. These embedded wallets are managed by Coinbase; Unlock Labs just saves a unique ID for the user to retrieve the wallet.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-future-plans-passkey-support">Future plans: PassKey support</h2></div><p>Unlock is also looking ahead to future enhancements. The team is currently working on updates to support PassKey authentication. This new standard is anticipated to further streamline the user experience. Once integrated, PassKey will offer users another robust option for authentication.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-unlocks-continued-focus-on-user-experience-improvements">Unlock’s continued focus on user experience improvements</h2></div><p>The introduction of email login underscores Unlock's commitment to improving user experience and security. By offering multiple authentication options, including the upcoming PassKey support, Unlock is paving the way for a more versatile and user-friendly app. Stay tuned for further updates and enhancements as Unlock continues to innovate and enhance its platform.</p><p></p><p></p>
