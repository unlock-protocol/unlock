Events and projects around the world have created their ticketing and membership infrastructure using Unlock Protocol.

Now, for events that want to get up and running rapidly, the Unlock Labs team has created a quickstart tool: **Events by Unlock**.

Events by Unlock is a free and easy way to create tickets and share an event details page for 10-10000+ person events. Setting up an event takes less than a minute, and it works for both free and paid events.

Using Unlock Protocol, event organizers have always been able to [create tickets for their events](https://unlock-protocol.com/guides/how-to-sell-nft-tickets-for-an-event/). After setting up ticketing, however, the next step is having a place where attendees can get their tickets! This new tool can help.

Events by Unlock was built by the Unlock Labs team using Unlock Protocol, and lets you set up your event on-chain in minutes. Fill in a few fields and deploy a smart contract for your event tickets with no code.

Then, once your contract is deployed, you can share your event landing page with the world!
