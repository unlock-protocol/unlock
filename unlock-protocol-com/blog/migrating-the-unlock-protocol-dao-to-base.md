<p>Unlock Labs has been working to put in place the necessary components that will enable the Unlock Protocol DAO to migrate from Ethereum mainnet to Base. This work is anticipated to be completed throughout the rest of Onchain Summer 2024, and has a number of interrelated components. At its simplest, there are two things required to enable the Unlock DAO to exist and manage the protocol from Base.</p><ul><li><p>Create a governance token for the Unlock DAO on Base</p></li><li><p>Deploy protocol governor contracts on Base</p></li></ul><p>While these are the two minimally-required items in order to do the migration, there are several steps on the way, which include:</p><ul><li><p>Creating an entity that can issue the new token</p></li><li><p>Putting in place mechanisms for existing UDT holders on mainnet to obtain the new token on Base (UDT is the governance token for the Unlock Protocol DAO on Ethereum mainnet)</p></li></ul><p>The rest of this document will go through a number of the key details regarding these activities, as well as dive into the motivations behind the move.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-what-does-a-sustainable-onchain-protocol-look-like">What does a sustainable onchain protocol look like?</h2></div><p>Taking a step back, there are three things that an open, onchain protocol needs in order to become sustainable.

governance</h2></div><p>Today, creating and voting on Unlock DAO proposals on Ethereum mainnet is an expensive proposition, primarily due to mainnet gas fees. Unlock Labs is proposing moving the Unlock DAO governance mechanisms to Base, thanks to Base’s speed, security, and affordability.</p><p>Unlock Labs believes this will greatly improve the accessibility of governance to members of the Unlock Protocol DAO, making it significantly faster and affordable to create and vote on DAO proposals.</p><p>The Unlock DAO on Base will be governed by way of governance tokens.

Every UDT token swapped will receive 1000 UP tokens in return.</p><p>At swap-time, UDT-holders will also be directed to explicitly delegate their voting power for their new UP tokens, in service of the goal of active participation in the Unlock DAO. Individuals will be able to self-delegate (i.e. vote their own tokens).

Moving the Unlock DAO governance to Base aims to reduce costs and improve accessibility, making it easier for members to participate.</p><p>Migrating the Unlock DAO to Base requires a new token, which will be called the Unlock Protocol token (UP) that will be issued by a new Foundation.</p><p>The new UP tokens on Base will facilitate proposal creation and voting via new governor contracts. Current UDT holders will swap their tokens for UP tokens at a 1-to-1000 ratio, enhancing active participation by delegating voting power. This transition is expected to make Unlock Protocol more efficient, inclusive, and sustainable.</p><p></p>
