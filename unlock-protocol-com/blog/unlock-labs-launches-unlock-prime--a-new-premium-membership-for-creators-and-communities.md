<p>Unlock Protocol has introduced <strong>Unlock Prime</strong>, a premium membership tier that offers enhanced features and exclusive benefits for creators and communities. Designed for those who are looking to elevate their onchain experiences, Unlock Prime provides a range of new tools, monthly rewards, and unlimited events, all on top of the core functionality offered by Unlock Basic.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-unlock-prime-more-features-more-benefits">Unlock Prime: More Features, More Benefits</h2></div><p>Unlock Prime offers a variety of powerful features to help creators grow their communities and host better events. Here are some of the key benefits members can expect:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Monthly ETH rewards</strong>: Unlock Prime members receive a monthly ETH reward valued at ~110% of their membership cost, helping to offset or even surpass the subscription fee.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unlimited airdrops</strong>: Easily distribute airdrops to your members or event attendees.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unlimited events</strong>: Enjoy unrestricted access to event creation, with additional features like advanced attendee check-in and multiple event layout templates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Exclusive partner discounts</strong>: Unlock Prime members get access to special discounts from event and service partners.</p></li><li><p><strong>Swag discounts</strong>: Unlock Protocol DAO will offer merch like t-shirts, stickers, and hats at discounted rates for Prime members.</p></li></ul><p>Unlock Prime is available for 1,000 UP per month, which is approximately $6 USDC at current rates in October 2024. Pricing may vary based on market conditions, but members can receive ETH rewards as part of their subscription — currently valued at about $7 USDC per month.† </p><p>Unlock Prime makes hosting events and building onchain communities easier and more rewarding. With features like unlimited airdrops and unlimited event creation, creators can continue to engage their audience without worrying about event limitations or participation caps.
