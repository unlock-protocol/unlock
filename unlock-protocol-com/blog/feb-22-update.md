Welcome to the February 2022 product updates from Unlock! The team delivered a number of new features this month that connect Unlock even more easily with standards and partners across the web3 ecosystem. This month's new capabilities include:

## Major updates to the Unlock checkout process

- **Bring Your Own NFT** — You can now [token gate anything using any ERC-721 NFT with Unlock Protocol](https://unlock-protocol.com/blog/bring-your-own-nft).
- **Sign In With Ethereum** — Unlock’s front-end now provides a “[Sign In With Ethereum](https://docs.unlock-protocol.com/tools/sign-in-with-ethereum)” endpoint that can be used by a third-party application to easily identify a user’s Ethereum address.

## Dashboard updates

- **Support for change of maximum number of keys on dashboard** — Creators can now change the maximum number of keys for their existing locks right from the dashboard.

## Dev tool updates

- **Unlock WebSub support** — The WebSub W3C standard enables publish/subscribe on any kind of HTTP resource. With [WebSub enabled for Unlock](https://unlock-protocol.com/blog/websub), applications can subscribe to Unlock changes, be notified when new locks are deployed, and be notified when new keys are created.
- **Plugin hardhat for Unlock** — Powered by [Hardhat](https://www.hardhat.org), we now have [tools to deploy and configure our contracts, submit DAO proposals, upgrade contracts](https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock/tree/master/packages/hardhat-plugin), etc.

## Integrations

- **Refactored Cloudflare worker** — We made [improvements to Unlock's CloudFlare worker](https://github.com/unlock-protocol/cloudflare-worker).
