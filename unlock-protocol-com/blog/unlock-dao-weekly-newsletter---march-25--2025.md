<div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h1 id="h-hey-locksmiths">Hey Locksmiths!</h1></div><p>We had another productive DAO call this week, and we made significant progress across multiple fronts. From protocol updates to new integrations and community initiatives, there's plenty to be excited about. Let's dive into the highlights.</p><p></p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-protocol-updates">Protocol Updates</h2></div><p>Julien shared important protocol improvements focused on enhancing stability and user experience. The team has been working on optimizing our RPC endpoint to prevent abuse from entities using it as free infrastructure. This optimization has already resulted in faster loading times for the web app, which is especially noticeable for users with multiple locks.</p><p>Additionally, the team identified and is addressing an issue with the swap and burn flow that could potentially be exploited. A protocol upgrade is being developed to ensure a minimum token amount for submissions, preventing potential sandwich attacks and creating a more efficient process overall.</p><p></p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-trading-competition-launch">Trading Competition Launch</h2></div><p>Mark your calendars! Our trading competition kicked off on April 1st and will run through the end of May. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://paragraph.com/@unlockprotocol/up-token-trading-competition-on-base?referrer=0xD2BC5cb641aE6f7A880c3dD5Aee0450b5210BE23">Here's what you need to know</a>. Registration is required and runs until the 18th of April. The top 10 traders will split up to 10 million governance tokens. This initiative aims to increase the trading volume of the UP token and establish a higher baseline of trading activity that can eventually sustain itself without additional incentives. Sample code has been provided for those interested in programmatic trading, and a dedicated dashboard will display real-time trading activity and registration status.</p><p></p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-new-integrations-and-partnerships">New Integrations &amp; Partnerships</h2></div><p>We're thrilled to announce several successful integration/ onboarding discussions:</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://warpcast.com/thecreators"><strong>The Creators</strong></a><strong>:</strong> We had an introductory conversation with digital artists and builders regarding integrating Unlock for membership tiers and metaverse integration.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://illust.ar/"><strong>Illust.AR</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A successful call has opened doors for potential collaboration with this augmented reality platform.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://app.unlock-protocol.com/events/metaverse-fashion-conference-2025"><strong>Fashion Metaverse Conference</strong></a><strong>:</strong> We've successfully onboarded this event, with five digital passports issued for their main events using Unlock Protocol.</p><p></p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-devcon-improvement-proposal">DEVCON Improvement Proposal</h2></div><p>A new proposal has been drafted to implement ticketing for DEVCON.
