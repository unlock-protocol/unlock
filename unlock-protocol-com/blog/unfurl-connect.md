## What is Unfurl Connect?

Unfurl Connect is a lock-aware identity provider – think “Connect with Google”, but with locks. It is fully Open ID Connect compliant so it works with virtually everything. Unfurl Connect was built by David Layton and was funded by the Unlock Protocol Grants Program.

## How does Unfurl Connect work?

Security roles are assigned/provided by querying the Unlock subgraphs on the backend with the relevant keys in the user's link wallet addresses and mapping the corresponding locks via the client's (lock manager) supplied lock-to-role mapping.

## What are the benefits of Unfurl Connect?

With Unfurl Connect, any app can go from no payment system, no login, and no user management to the gold standard for web security with 20-60 minutes of effort using Unlock and Unfurl. This should halve the development time for most SaaS-style MVPs using Unlock.

Additionally the added convenience, credibility/quality, and eventual network effect of this uniform experience across crypto-paid applications should drive adoption for Unlock but the penetration of crypto in general.
