A few months ago, when we introduced the [Unlock Grants Program](/blog/token-grant-program), [Camille](https://twitter.com/CamilleBesse), a french growth hacker was one of the very first to apply so he could build an integration with Discourse! [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) is an ope-source Internet forum and mailing list management software application used by many communities around the web.

# Discourse Plugin

Camille's idea was that communities on Discourse could easily monetize by restricting access to some Categories where only members would be allowed to read or write new topics. All of these members own a membership NFT in their crypto wallets.

In the crypto space, many protocols have their governance discussions on Discourse servers. They could easily use their native ERC20 as the currency of their membership.

To add a lock to your Discourse forum, follow [Camille's tutorial](https://unlock.community/t/unlock-discourse-plugin/64). And of course, you can use any lock, including [xDAI](/blog/xdai) or [Polygon locks](/blog/unlock-on-polygon), as well as enable [credit card checkout](/blog/credit-card-nft) :)


# Unlock.community

At Unlock, we believe we should always be the first users of our protocol, and today, we're also excited to announce [unlock.community](https://unlock.community/), a forum where the Unlock [developers](https://unlock.community/c/dev/6), [creators](https://unlock.community/c/creators/12) and [governors](https://unlock.community/c/governance/5) can discuss their use of the protocol or ideas to make it better.

One of the most attractive features of using Unlock is that memberships go cross-platforms. Even though we did lock some of the categories on the Discourse forum, we used the same lock as on our Discord server or even here, on this blog: the same Unlock membership follows you everywhere on the web.
