Many creators and event organizers want to airdrop NFTs in bulk. To make this easier, we’ve added ability to upload spreadsheet (CSV) containing recipients and metadata. 

After you upload the spreadsheet, we will show you a list of addresses with the number of NFT keys to be airdropped to them. We automatically remove duplicates, invalid entries, resolve ENS names, and run validation before showing the members.

If you want to store additional metadata, you can put it as a column and fill the value. We will automatically add it. To make it public, `.public` suffix can also be added. 

We’re excited to bring more no-code tools to lock managers so they can easily manage members!
