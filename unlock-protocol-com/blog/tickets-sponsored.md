Last month, we introduced [Unlock for tickets](/blog/introducing-tickets): a unique ethereum based ticketing application.
It lets anyone sell tickets to their events as keys to an Unlock lock. Attendees receive a unique Non Fungible Token and [the application](https://tickets.unlock-protocol.com/) even lets the organizers verify if the tickets are valid at check-in. Like any other lock, keys can be priced [using an ERC20 token](/blog/erc20-locks) like DAI for organizers whose costs are in US Dollars, or a specific utility token for organizers who want to leverage their own coins!

Today, we're excited to announce a broad sponsorship effort for anyone who uses tickets to organize an Ethereum or Bitcoin related event for any event until December 31st 2019.

Our sponsorship package is simple:

- Use a lock to sell tickets, using Ether or DAI,
- We will match ticket sales up to 3 DAI per key sold, for up to 1,000 tickets sold.

We will also help you by _promoting your event_, guide you through the set-up of your event page as well as _design a custom NFT image_ that all of your participants will receive in their web3 wallet (check this one from the [Berlin Open Source Salon](https://tickets.unlock-protocol.com/event/0x98c0cbf0e9525f1a6975a51c9d5e8e063c034d6d), or the [NFT Dev Meetup](https://tickets.unlock-protocol.com/event/0x5865Ff2CBd045Ef1cfE19739df19E83B32b783b4)).

If you're running an ethereum meetup, a DeFi group, a hackathon, reach out to us via email hello@unlock-protocol.com and tell us more about the event you're organizing: we'd love to help!
