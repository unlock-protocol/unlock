<h1 id="h-hey-locksmiths" class="text-4xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0">Hey Locksmiths!</h1><p>Happy New Year! As we kick off 2026, the first newsletter of the year serves double duty:</p><blockquote><p> A look back at everything we accomplished in 2025 and a look at the road ahead.</p></blockquote><p>Our first DAO call of the year was a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/dyiRpIl_lmg?si=E-ClpYqsXb-XtzEq">2025 Wrapped</a> celebration where community members shared highlights and reflected on the work that brought us to where we are today. It was also a moment of transition, with significant announcements about leadership changes and DAO funding that will shape how we operate going forward.</p><p>2025 tested the resilience of the Web3 space, and Unlock Protocol DAO proved it has what it takes to grow in the face of adversity. Dedicated contributors ushered in strategic collaborations, and as a community, we marched forward to new levels of decentralization; we've built something worth being proud of! Now, as we step into 2026, the DAO is poised to take full ownership of its future in new and exciting ways.</p><p>Let's dig into what happened and what's next.</p><h2 id="h-unlock-labs-foundation" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0">Unlock Labs Foundation</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Unlock Labs Funding Update</strong>: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliengenestoux/">Julien</a> shared that Unlock Labs has reached the end of its runway and will no longer be able to fund DAO operations beyond January 2026. The protocol itself remains fully decentralized and onchain—it doesn't need Labs to function.</p></li><li><p><strong>Foundation Wind-Down</strong>: The Unlock Labs Foundation will be dissolved later this year, as it no longer serves a purpose that justifies the operational cost. When this happens, approximately 40% of the token supply currently held by the Foundation will transfer to the DAO treasury, providing long-term resources for community-driven development.</p></li><li><p><strong>Decentralization Milestone</strong>: These changes represent a significant step toward full decentralization. There's never been a more accessible entry point for new participants to get involved in governance and help shape Unlock's direction.</p></li></ul><h2 id="h-dao-operations-updates" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0">DAO Operations Updates</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Stella's Transition</strong>: After nearly two years of dedicated stewardship, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stellaachenbach/">Stella</a> is not renewing her Steward role in order to return focus to her own project, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://x.com/alana_xyz">The ALANA Project</a>, as it approaches key stages of growth.
