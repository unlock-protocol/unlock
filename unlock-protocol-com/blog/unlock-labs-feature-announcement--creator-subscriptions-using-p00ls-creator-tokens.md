<p>P00LS Creator Tokens are ERC20 tokens that are issued by creators on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover" href="https://p00ls.gitbook.io/p00ls-v2/p00ls-creator-tokens/understanding-p00ls-creator-tokens">P00LS protocol</a> and distributed to a creatorâ€™s engaged audience. You can think of P00LS tokens in the same way you think about miles for an airline miles program or points in credit card point systems.</p><p>Each creator has their own token, which represents a creator's economy and ecosystem. It tracks community engagement on all the platforms a creator is active on, all the digital assets they create, and all the tools they use to map and index their community.</p><p>You can learn more about P00LS Creator Tokens in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover" href="https://p00ls.gitbook.io/p00ls-v2">P00LS docs</a>.</p><p>One of the opportunities that creators have with Creator Tokens is to create paid memberships and subscriptions that are priced using their own token.</p><p>P00LS is now integrated with Unlock Protocol. This means that creators can price their subscriptions and memberships directly in their own token.</p><p>Here is a demonstration on how to integrate P00LS with Unlock Protocol.</p><div data-type="youtube" videoid="iD29rg3e7Ug">
