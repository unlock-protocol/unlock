<p>Welcome to this week's Unlock DAO newsletter! We're excited to share the latest updates from our recent DAO call, highlighting important developments, upcoming events, and opportunities for community engagement. Let's dive into the key points that are shaping the future of Unlock DAO.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-dao-process-changes-streamlining-our-operations"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out sh-color-blue sh-color" href="https://discord.com/channels/462280183425138719/1303427733048787034">DAO Process Changes: Streamlining Our Operations</a></h3></div><p>In our ongoing effort to improve efficiency and transparency, we've implemented several changes to our DAO processes. These first updates are the move from L1 Ethereum to L2 Base to lower the financial barriers for voting, a shorter period to pass proposals of now 14 days to become more agile, a 50k Up threshold to submit proposals for safety reasons, and the almost completed Charmverse based collaborative space for active DAO members. These changes are just the first of more, but they are a start and will help us operate more effectively as we continue to grow and take on new challenges.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-dex-selection-and-incentives-on-base-expanding-our-reach"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out sh-color-blue sh-color" href="https://discord.com/channels/462280183425138719/1277768997932367893">DEX Selection and Incentives on Base: Expanding Our Reach</a></h3></div><p>We're thrilled to announce significant progress in our expansion to the Base network.

With the recently passed proposal by the DAO incentives for liquidity providers are up and can be tapped into by using the GAMMA suit. Learn more by following the Unlock DAO LinkedIn. This partnership will provide Unlock DAO with increased liquidity and exposure to a broader user base.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-reminder-retroactive-funding-for-november-2024"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out sh-color-blue sh-color" href="https://discord.com/channels/462280183425138719/1302177400171532349">Reminder: Retroactive Funding for November 2024</a></h3></div><p>As we approach the end of November, we want to remind all community members about our Retroactive Funding round.
