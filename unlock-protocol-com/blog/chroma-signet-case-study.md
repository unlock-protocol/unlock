Chroma Signet uses blockchain-based solutions to provide supply chain transparency and provenance across the entire consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry. When brands want to share seed-to-sale supply chain data, in-depth ingredient details, or their brand story with customers, they choose Chroma Signet. 

When Chroma Signet wanted to enhance their offering and additionally offer a digital twin for every instance of every product in the supply chain in the form of an NFT, they went searching for a solution and found their answer in the Unlock Protocol.
