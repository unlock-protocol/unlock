Content Management Systems make it easy for people to create their own websites. [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) is one of the most popular CMS. Drupal is open source and developers can easily customize each Drupal instance. Today, they're also able to easily add locks to limit access to content of features to visitors which own keys to these locks!

A couple of weeks ago, external contributor [Mike Purvis](https://twitter.com/mikedotexe) asked if Unlock would work with Drupal. He quickly rose to the challenge and worked on a plugin; you can now [install it on your own Drupal website](https://www.drupal.org/project/unlock)! It is also [fully open source too](https://github.com/mikedotexe/unlock), so you can of course help improve it!

To showcase it, Mike created a website where you can [unlock dad jokes](https://untoldhq.com/unlock-dad-jokes) ;) Perfect way to end a busy week!
