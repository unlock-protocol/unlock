And it made me realize that the way we’ve been doing memberships online all these years, with passwords, credit cards, and middlemen, is long overdue for change.</p><p>That change is onchain memberships. And no one is building them better than Unlock.</p><hr><h2 id="h-memberships-that-actually-belong-to-you" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0"><strong>Memberships That Actually Belong to You</strong></h2><p>Most of us have experienced the frustration of traditional memberships:</p><ul><li><p>Forget your password and you’re locked out.</p></li><li><p>Your card expires, and access is suddenly gone.</p></li><li><p>A platform shuts down, and your subscription disappears with it.</p></li></ul><p>All of that happens because the membership isn’t really yours. It’s tied to a company’s server. They decide the rules, and you just rent space.</p><p>Unlock flips this old narrative. With Unlock, your membership is an NFT key that "lives" in your wallet. You hold it. You control it. You can even take it with you if you move to a new platform.</p><p>It’s like the difference between renting an apartment and owning a home. Renting gives you access, but the landlord makes the rules. Ownership gives you security and freedom.</p><hr><h2 id="h-how-unlock-makes-it-simple" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0"><strong>How Unlock Makes It Simple</strong></h2><p>When people hear “onchain,” they sometimes imagine it’s complicated or technical. But Unlock has worked hard to make it simple.</p><p>Here’s what happens when a creator, developer, community organizer or anyone else uses Unlock:</p><ol><li><p>They create a "lock" (deploy a code-free smart contract) that defines the membership terms and functions.</p></li><li><p>They issue keys, or their community can mint NFT passes directly from the contract (lock).</p></li><li><p>The key is minted either to the user's wallet or to their email, but it can also be airdropped to either by the lock creator (and any additional lock managers that can be set).</p></li></ol><p>That’s it. Once the key is in your wallet, you’re in—no middleman, no endless sign-ups, no passwords to reset.</p><p>And because it’s programmable, those keys can do more than just “open the door.” They can also:</p><ul><li><p>Unlock private Discord and Telegram channels.</p></li><li><p>Give discounts on future purchases.</p></li><li><p>Double or be an event ticket, certification, recurring subscription, product, and more.</p></li><li><p>Serve as your identity across different platforms.</p></li></ul><p>Unlock makes what used to feel like a boring subscription into something alive, portable, and customizable.</p><hr><h2 id="h-communities-built-to-last" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0"><strong>Communities Built to Last</strong></h2><p>One of the most powerful things about Unlock is how it strengthens communities.</p><ul><li><p>A writer who uses Unlock can keep their readers even if they leave Substack or Medium. Readers carry their keys with them.</p></li><li><p>A musician can sell concert tickets directly to fans, without ticket scalpers or service fees.</p></li><li><p>A DAO can use a single key for both membership verification and voting rights, all in one system.</p></li></ul><p>In every case, the community becomes more resilient because it isn’t tied to a single platform. The keys stay with the people, not the companies.</p><p>This matters. Platforms come and go. Servers crash. Rules change. But an onchain membership issued through Unlock doesn’t vanish. It belongs to the member as long as they hold the key.</p><hr><h2 id="h-why-its-the-future" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0"><strong>Why It’s the Future</strong></h2><p>We live in a world where identity and belonging are increasingly digital. People join communities online the way they used to join local clubs or associations.</p><p>But the tools we’ve had so far have been inadequate. They’ve treated memberships like recurring payments, not like relationships.</p><p>Unlock says:</p><ul><li><p>Memberships should be portable.</p></li><li><p>Members should own their access.</p></li><li><p>Communities should not be at the mercy of centralized platforms.</p></li></ul><p>And once you see that, it’s hard to unsee it. Why would anyone go back to the old way once they’ve experienced the freedom of holding their own key?</p><hr><h2 id="h-unlock-in-action" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0"><strong>Unlock in Action</strong></h2><p>What I love most is that Unlock isn’t just an idea, it’s already being used every day.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Event Ticketing</strong><br>Organizers are selling tickets on-chain through Unlock’s EVENTS tool, proving that ticketing doesn’t need middlemen.</p></li><li><p><strong>Communities:</strong><br>Unlock communities to use keys for governance, rewarding contributors, and managing access to calls or forums.</p></li><li><p><strong>Creators: </strong><br>Writers, artists, and educators issue memberships that travel with their audiences, free from platform lock-in.</p></li></ul><p>Each use case shows the same thing: when people hold the keys, the community becomes stronger.</p><hr><h2 id="h-looking-ahead" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0"><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h2><p>We’re still early, but the direction is clear. In the same way email became the universal tool for communication, onchain memberships are becoming the universal tool for access and belonging.</p><p>Unlock isn’t just about building infrastructure; it’s about shaping the culture around it. A culture where members don’t just pay, they participate. Where access isn’t rented, it’s owned, where communities are free to grow without fear of being shut down.</p><p>That’s why onchain memberships aren’t just the future. They’re the fair, sustainable, people-powered future we’ve been waiting for.</p><p>And with Unlock, that future is already here.</p><hr><h2 id="h-until-the-next-key-turns" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0"><strong>Until the next key turns!</strong></h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="dont-break-out graf markup--anchor markup--anchor-readOnly" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalu-vincent-704896192/"><strong>GozmanGonzalez</strong></a><br>Your Storyteller Locksmith</p><hr><h2 id="h-join-us" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0"><strong>Join Us</strong></h2><ul><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="dont-break-out graf markup--anchor markup--anchor-readOnly" href="https://x.com/UnlockProtocol"><strong>X</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="dont-break-out graf markup--anchor markup--anchor-readOnly" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@unlock.dao?_t=ZT-8sqNLXE6lfn&amp;_r=1"><strong>Tik Tok</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="dont-break-out graf markup--anchor markup--anchor-readOnly" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/unlock-protocol-dao/"><strong>LinkedIn</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="dont-break-out graf markup--anchor markup--anchor-readOnly" href="https://www.youtube.com/@UnlockProtocol%20Farcaster%20Account%20%7C%20https://warpcast.com/unlock-protocol"><strong>YouTube</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="dont-break-out graf markup--anchor markup--anchor-readOnly" href="https://farcaster.xyz/unlock-protocol"><strong>Farcaster</strong></a><br></p></li></ul><br>
