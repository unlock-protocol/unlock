As a community-supported, free and open-source crypto tool suite, MyCrypto needed a solution to turn “users” into “paying users” to help fund future initiatives. In 2019, MyCrypto began looking for a way to offer MyCrypto memberships. 

MyCrypto envisioned a future where, when community members offered their financial support, those supporters gained members-only access to exclusive perks in return for becoming a paying member of the community. After exploring a number of options (including building their own solution stack), MyCrypto found their answer in the Unlock Protocol.
