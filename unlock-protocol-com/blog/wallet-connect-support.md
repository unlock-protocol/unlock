The most recent NFT craze is bringing a lot of new users down the crypto rabbit-hole. Many of them are using Metamask as they discover the wonders of self-sovereign identity. Many of them are also discovering web3 through the lens of a native application such as [Rainbow](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rainbow-ethereum-wallet/id1457119021), [Trust](https://trustwallet.com/), [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/), and more.

Sometimes, these applications include browser web views, but they may not always be the user's preferred browser. In the Ethereum world, [Pedro Gomes](https://github.com/pedrouid) came up with the right idea: [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org/)!

Now that we're all used to ordering food with QR codes, it has become very simple to use a QR code to connect a dapp inside any web browser (ðŸ‘‹ Firefox, Chrome or, Safari) to your wallet on a different device!

Today, we're excited to announce that all the Unlock front-end applications, from [our dashboard](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/dashboard) which lets creators deploy their own NFT contracts, to our paywall applications that lets them easily add locks to their web pages, support WalletConnect!
