<p>When you join a new community, there's always that moment of confusion: <em>"Okay, Iâ€™m hereâ€¦ but how do I actually take part?"</em> Thatâ€™s exactly how I felt when I first started hanging around the Unlock DAO. I kept hearing about "UDT migration" and "UP governance," and honestly, at first, it sounded like some secret language only insiders understood.</p><p>But here's the truth: it's not that complicated once you see the story behind it. This is my attempt to explain the shift from <strong>UDT</strong> to <strong>UP</strong> in plain, human words and, more importantly, to show you how you can step into Unlock's governance without feeling lost.</p><br><h2 id="h-the-old-token-udt-and-its-limitations" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0">The Old Token: UDT and Its Limitations</h2><p>For years, UDT (Unlock Discount Token) was the governance token of Unlock DAO. It gave holders a voice in shaping the future of the protocol, such as funding initiatives, adjusting functions in the technology, and supporting builders.</p><p>But UDT lived on Ethereum mainnet, which, as many of us know, can be expensive and sometimes intimidating for newcomers. Every time you tried to vote or delegate, you'd pay relatively high gas fees. This resulted in low participation, despite a high willingness to contribute.</p><p>Think of UDT as the first set of keys to a brand-new house. They worked fine for opening the door, but they weren't designed for long-term use.</p><br><h2 id="h-why-the-move-to-base" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0">Why the Move to Base?</h2><p>In 2024, Unlock community made a bold move: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://paragraph.com/@unlockprotocol/migrating-unlock-protocol-dao-base">migrate governance from Ethereum to Base</a>, a faster and cheaper layer-2 blockchain. This wasn't just about saving a few dollars on gas fees. It was about opening the doors wider so more people could join the conversation without being held back by cost.</p><p>And along with that move came a new token: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://apebond.click/UP">$UP</a>.</p><p>The name feels fitting, doesn't it? <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://apebond.click/UP">$UP</a> is about moving forward, leveling up, and providing the community with a governance tool that matches the protocol's vision of openness and inclusivity.</p><br><h2 id="h-what-is-up" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0">What Is UP?</h2><p>$UP is the governance token for Unlock Protocol DAO. If you held UDT, you could <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://paragraph.com/@unlockprotocol/bridge-earn">swap it for UP at a 1:1000 ratio</a>. This means every UDT turned into a thousand UP tokens. The swap was done to keep the numbers practical and to start fresh with a new identity on Base.</p><p>So now, UP is the key to Unlock's governance. It doesn't matter if you've been here for years or just discovered the community; if you have UP, you have a voice!</p><br><h2 id="h-governance-made-simple" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0">Governance Made Simple</h2><p>Okay, but how does governance actually work in Unlock DAO? Let's strip away the intimidating layers.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Delegation</strong><br>When you hold UP, you can now vote directly on proposals. But first, you need to delegate your token to either yourself or another person you trust within the Unlock Protocol DAO community. For this purpose, you can use either <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://www.tally.xyz/gov/unlock-protocol">Tally</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://unlock.degov.ai/">degov</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Proposal Discussion</strong><br>Most ideas start on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://discord.gg/v8wFYQ6DVu">Discord Forum</a>. Itâ€™s like the brainstorming room where community members float concepts and get early feedback.</p></li><li><p><strong>Proposal Voting</strong><br>Finally, proposals that pass move to our onchain voting system on Base. This is where the binding vote happens. </p></li><li><p><strong>Voting Power</strong><br>Each UP token equals one vote. Voting can be done either directly via the block explorer on Base or via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://unlock.degov.ai/">degov</a>/<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://www.tally.xyz/gov/unlock-protocol">Tally</a>. A proposal needs a 3-million-vote UP token quorum to pass. That means governance works best when people actually participate, not just watch from the sidelines.</p></li></ol><br><h2 id="h-why-this-matters-for-you" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0">Why This Matters for You</h2><p>You might be wondering, "<em>I'm just one person. Does my vote really matter?</em>"</p><p>Here's the thing: DAOs live and die by the people who show up. Even small contributions, asking good questions in a forum thread, delegating your tokens, or writing up a clear explanation for others, add real value.</p><p>When I first joined, I felt like a tiny fish in a big pond. But then I realized the DAO isn't some faceless machine. It's people or the Locksmiths, as we like to call ourselves, who care enough to shape the protocol together. Every vote adds weight to that collective voice.</p><br><h2 id="h-the-human-side-of-governance" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0">The Human Side of Governance</h2><p>What I love about the shift to UP is that it lowered the barrier to entry. Before, governance felt like something reserved for the few who were willing to spend gas fees on Ethereum. Now, it feels more like a community town hall, where anyone can grab a chair and speak up.</p><p>And honestly, that's what drew me deeper into Unlock. Governance isn't just about rules and contracts. It's about people deciding together: Where should treasury funds go? What features should we prioritize? How do we make this protocol sustainable long-term?</p><br><h2 id="h-how-to-get-started" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0">How to Get Started</h2><p>Don't worry, getting involved is actually way easier than it sounds. Here's the path most Locksmiths take when they're just starting out:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Step inside the Discord</strong><br>Click <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://discord.gg/v8wFYQ6DVu">here</a> and join the Unlock server. You'll land in the lobby where all new members arrive.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unlock the Discord with a free membership NFT</strong><br>In the <strong>#lobby</strong> channel, you'll see an option to claim your&nbsp;<strong>free</strong>&nbsp;membership pass. Enter the command "<strong>/unlock</strong>," hit enter, and click the link. This brings you directly to an Unlock-powered checkout. Connect your wallet or add your email to receive the NFT. Make sure to click "Back to Discord" on the last page of the checkout.</p></li><li><p><strong>Say hello</strong><br>Head over to the <strong>#introductions</strong> channel and drop a quick message using the template.</p></li><li><p><strong>Explore the space</strong><br>Check the <strong>#official-links</strong>, check out every channel, and get a feel for how the community works. It's a friendly space, and nobody expects you to have all the answers on day one. Feel free to ask any question on the <strong><span data-name="flag_us" class="emoji" data-type="emoji">ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</span>â€”general-chat-english</strong> or <strong><span data-name="flag_es" class="emoji" data-type="emoji">ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸</span>â€”general-chat-spanish</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Join a weekly call every Tuesday</strong><br>This is where the magic really happens. Hearing people's voices, listening to their questions, and maybe even asking one of your own makes governance feel a lot less abstract and a lot more real.</p></li></ol><p>By the end of these steps, you won't feel like an outsider anymore. You'll be a <strong>Locksmith</strong> with your own key, part of the conversation, and ready to help shape what comes next.</p><br><h2 id="h-looking-ahead" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0">Looking Ahead</h2><p>The transition from UDT to UP wasn't just a token swap. It was a signal: Unlock DAO is serious about growing participation and making governance accessible. We've moved from a heavy, costly system to one that's lighter, faster, and more inviting. That's not the end of the story, it's just the start of a new chapter.</p><p>So if you've been sitting on the sidelines, this is your moment. Grab your UP, join the locksmith community, and help us decide what gets built, funded, and celebrated next. Because governance isn't about tokens, it's about people. And in Unlock, people like <strong>you</strong> truly make the difference.</p><hr><h2 id="h-until-the-next-key-turns" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0"><strong>Until the next key turns!</strong></h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalu-vincent-704896192/">GozmanGonzalez</a> <br>Your Storyteller Locksmith</p><hr><h2 id="h-join-us" class="text-3xl font-header !mt-8 !mb-4 first:!mt-0 first:!mb-0"><strong>Join Us</strong></h2><ul><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="dont-break-out graf markup--anchor markup--anchor-readOnly" href="https://x.com/UnlockProtocol"><strong>X</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="dont-break-out graf markup--anchor markup--anchor-readOnly" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@unlock.dao?_t=ZT-8sqNLXE6lfn&amp;_r=1"><strong>Tik Tok</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="dont-break-out graf markup--anchor markup--anchor-readOnly" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/unlock-protocol-dao/"><strong>LinkedIn</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="dont-break-out graf markup--anchor markup--anchor-readOnly" href="https://www.youtube.com/@UnlockProtocol%20Farcaster%20Account%20%7C%20https://warpcast.com/unlock-protocol"><strong>YouTube</strong></a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="dont-break-out graf markup--anchor markup--anchor-readOnly" href="https://farcaster.xyz/unlock-protocol"><strong>Farcaster</strong></a></p></li></ul><br>
