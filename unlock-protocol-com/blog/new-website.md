After a few weeks of work, we're proud to release our brand new website! We need a refresher to showcase some of the things we worked on over the last few months.

Unlock is a protocol for memberships as Non Fungible Tokens that enables creators to monetize their content, community, features on their terms!

We wanted to highlight the **documentation** that developers can use to create, deploy and integrate locks on their sites or inside other 3rd party applications.

We also wanted to showcase some of the best **integrations** that our community has already built to enable new kinds of monetization for creators.

Finally, [our UDT grants program](https://share.hsforms.com/1gAdLgNOESNCWJ9bJxCUAMwbvg22) now gets a prime spot on our home page. We're building an open protocol and we want all of the builders and users to get a say in the governance.
