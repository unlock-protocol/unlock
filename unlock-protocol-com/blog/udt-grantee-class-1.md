We’re excited to announce our pioneering set of Unlock Token Grantees!  We’re looking forward to seeing how they apply Unlock in new ways. You can [learn more about the grant program here](https://share.hsforms.com/1gAdLgNOESNCWJ9bJxCUAMwbvg22).


## What is the Unlock Token Grant Program?

The Unlock Token Grant Program is all about increasing the amount of people building with Unlock, by encouraging and supporting developers that create plugins, processes and documentation that make it easier for people to use Unlock.

## What are we looking for?

Our five criteria are as follows:

* **Impact** - could this impact a lot of users?

* **Clarity** - Does the project include user experience, aesthetics and anything else that makes the solution clear, accessible and easy to use once implemented?

* **Feasibility** - is this a reasonable implementation?

* **Team** - Does the team have the skills to make this happen?

* **Maturity** - is this a brand new startup or a launched system with revenue?

## Learn more about our Token Grant Program!

Part of supporting unlock and being part of the community is building token grants to increase usage of Unlock!

If you have a project in mind and would like to [submit a grant application](https://share.hsforms.com/1gAdLgNOESNCWJ9bJxCUAMwbvg22), please do!

We review all applications on a monthly basis. You’ll get a notification when your grant is under review and whether it has been accepted or rejected.

Each grantee will get a token grant that vests monthly starting 12 months from the start of the grant period. Once the project is completed, the vested funds will be delivered by smart contract, and the rest of the funds will be delivered each month until the end of the grant period.

Want to learn a bit more about Unlock? Join us in the [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/ByZjth3P) or check out the [developer documentation](https://docs.unlock-protocol.com/) for ideas.

Congratulations to all of the grantees, and thanks again for supporting Unlock!
