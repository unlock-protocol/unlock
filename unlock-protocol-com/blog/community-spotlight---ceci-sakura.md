<p>Did you know that Unlock DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that governs the actual protocol? These are ordinary people, like you and me, making decisions about the protocol and its future developments in a decentralized manner, utilizing the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://docs.unlock-protocol.com/governance/unlock-dao/">$UP token as a governance currency</a>. DAO Members propose new ideas through proposals and vote on them to help the protocol be future-proof. However, aside from DAO Members, we also have DAO Contributors, Ambassadors, and Stewards. These members have dedicated additional resources and time to the ever-evolving future of Unlock Protocol. </p><p>Yesterday, I had the pleasure of chatting with Ceci Sakura, also known as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cecilia-contreras-castro/"><strong>Cecilia (Andrea) Contreras Castro</strong></a>, who is the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://snapshot.box/#/s:unlock-dao.eth/proposal/0x59c86aaa1c0abd34329dc4fdd72acd5230b4e574c1e8e65115daecbddf0527a9">elected Steward for Marketing &amp; Communications</a> at Unlock Protocol DAO. She is also the co-founder of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://refibolivia.org/">ReFi Bolivia</a> and a core member at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://www.ethereumbolivia.org/">ETH Bolivia</a>. Her story is fascinating and surprising to say the least! In our interview, she confessed to wanting to have dinner with Pink Floyd, her parents being her mentors, and also highlighted the need for financial literacy among more people.
