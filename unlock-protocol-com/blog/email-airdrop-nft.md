Long-time users of Unlock know that the Unlock dashboard contains functionality that allows someone logged in with the "Lock Manager" role to airdrop keys to a list of recipients using their wallet addresses. Did you know that you can also airdrop NFTs using someone's email address?

The email generated includes a QR code of the signed NFT the recipient can use to prove ownership, for example, when showing an NFT ticket when attending in-person events.

Here are the key items.

## There is an email field on the airdrop screen

You can go into the Tools menu to airdrop.

An "email" field is included on the airdrop screen.

## Additional email actions on the "Members" page

In addition to airdropping the NFT via email, lock managers have additional membership actions they can perform on the "Members" page of the dashboard:

- Add or edit the email for a specific key
- Send QR-code by email
