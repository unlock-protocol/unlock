The Unlock creator dashboard already included the functionality that allows someone logged in with the "Lock Manager" role to airdrop keys to a list of recipients. Now we've added the ability to send an email simultaneously!

The email generated will also include a QR code of the signed NFT that they can use to prove that they own it when attending in-person events and a link to view their NFT. Let's take a look at the changes!

## New field added to the airdrop screen
A new field "email" is now present on the airdrop screen.

You can still send them without the email if you wish.

## New actions added to the "Members" page
Some new action buttons are now visible on the "Members" page:

- Add or edit the email for a specific key
- Send QR-code by email
