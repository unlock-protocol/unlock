Last month, Unlock Protocol participated in ETH Global’s [HackFS Hackathon](https://fs.ethglobal.com/) as a sponsor. The hackathon’s theme was to help build the web3 foundation, so of course, we were all over that mission!

We’re so pleased that eight teams won a little $UDT for deploying our protocol in their projects. Seeing what’s possible with Unlock by such amazingly creative and brilliant dev teams is a pure delight for the Unlock team and we’re so excited we could support this hackathon.

The diversity of projects that each team who deployed our protocol in some aspect of their work really shows the depth of what's possible with Unlock. From gaming vaults with locked content, checkout components in e-commerce to collector cards; each of the following teams integrated Unlock in a way that shows the scope of what's possible with our protocol.

Here’s a quick look at all of the projects who deployed our protocol. Be sure to click through to the projects that interest you and follow these teams as some are continuing to build out the projects that began during HackFS.

Supporting hackathons and the hackers who are helping build the foundational technology of web3 is a great pleasure and honor for our team. We're so delighted to see all the hard work, ingenuity, and creativity that went into each project (especially those who deployed Unlock). We look forward to seeing these projects take on a new life outside of the hackathon setting and are here to help everyone using Unlock to build a better internet!
