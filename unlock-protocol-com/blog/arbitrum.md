[Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/) is a "layer 2" environment on top of Ethereum's mainnet. It is an _optimistic rollup_, which means that it is able to benefit from Ethereum's security while providing significantly cheaper transaction costs, as well as much faster execution time.

> Today, we're excited to announce that you can start deploying your NFT membership contracts on Arbitrum!

Want to try it out? We deployed the first NFT membership contract on Arbitrum and you can "buy" a free membership [by going here](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/checkout?redirectUri=https%3A%2F%2Funlock-protocol.com%2Fblog%2Farbitrum&paywallConfig=%7B%22locks%22%3A%7B%220xcc04a8E25B712EBbdAD337dfDb59a154Bd6bbd06%22%3A%7B%22network%22%3A42161%7D%7D%2C%22pessimistic%22%3Atrue%2C%22persistentCheckout%22%3Atrue%2C%22icon%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fstaging-locksmith.unlock-protocol.com%2Flock%2F0xcc04a8E25B712EBbdAD337dfDb59a154Bd6bbd06%2Ficon%22%7D) (There are only 100 of these, so be quick!)

Unlock has now been deployed on 8 EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) networks: Mainnet, Gnosis Chain, Polygon, Optimism, BNB Chain, Celo, Avalanche and now Arbitrum! Every creator, brand or organization can chose the network of _their_ choice to deploy their membership contracts to create [NFT tickets](https://unlock-protocol.com/guides/how-to-sell-nft-tickets-for-an-event/), [subscriptions](https://unlock-protocol.com/guides/recurring-memberships/) and more!
