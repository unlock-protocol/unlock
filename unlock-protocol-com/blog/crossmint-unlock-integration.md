Unlock Protocol is now integrated with [Crossmint](https://crossmint.com), expanding its credit card and other payment processing options! Working with Crossmint grants developers who are building on Unlock Protocol an additional avenue for implementing fiat transactions, specifically credit card payments. 

Crossmint is known for providing comprehensive APIs and tools for NFT creation, distribution, and custody, with a focus on exceptional user experience. Crossmint has been used by over 15,000 developers and companies, and has SDKs that support minting, payment and wallet management.

## Why Crossmint?

By leveraging Crossmint's suite of APIs and tools, there is now a new way to streamline the creation of memberships, tickets, and other related items through Unlock’s checkout. This integration also vastly improves the overall user experience. 

With Crossmint's expertise in facilitating credit card and cross-chain crypto payments, developers and other users of Unlock Protocol can now enjoy a broader range of payment options, connecting the decentralized world with other finance systems.

Crossmint works in over 180 countries all over the world and in all US states.

## How does it work?

When a user initiates a payment for an Unlock-powered transaction via Crossmint, either through credit card or another fiat method, the payment is converted into the requisite cryptocurrency. Then, the payments are transferred to the associated lock's smart contract.

This integration ensures that even though users might transact in fiat currencies, the underlying mechanics remain true to the idea of decentralization, and enable a similar user experience regardless of whether a transaction is executed using fiat or cryptocurrency.

## Availability

Unlock’s integration with Crossmint is currently in beta. A reference integration is live today, and is being used by [ETHVietnam](https://www.eth-vietnam.com/) for supporting credit card ticketing transactions.

As we continue refining the experience, we invite developers who are eager to explore this integration to reach out to either Unlock or Crossmint for guidance on setting things up. 

We value your feedback and insights during this phase. 

## What’s next?

As we progress, our goal is to transition to a fully self-serve platform, empowering developers with a seamless and autonomous experience with a focus on composability. Your early engagement is invaluable in shaping the future of this collaborative endeavor!
