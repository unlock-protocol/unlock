ETHDenver is an annual event that brings together developers, builders, and other members of the Ethereum community to collaborate and build decentralized applications and features talks, workshops, and hackathons. (And it’s a ***huge*** event — this year’s ETHDenver attracted over 30,000 attendees from around the world.) 

The Unlock team was everywhere at ETHDenver 2023! Here are some of the highlights…

## Presentations and panels

### **Spruce did:day**

As part of the lightning talk series at Spruce’s Digital ID Day (did:day) event, Unlock’s Founder and CEO Julien Genestoux discussed the importance of memberships in Web3 as well as the capabilities that are enabled when those memberships are no longer “perpetual,” but instead are infused with a time component in the form of expiration dates.

### ETHDenver Presentation: Creator Control — How Web3 is Leveling the Playing Field for Creators

In this talk, Unlock’s Head of Marketing Christopher Carfi discussed how NFTs are enabling creators to have true ownership of their communities. As technology gives creators the power to bring their communities with them in and outside of platforms, Chris explored how Web3 changes the power dynamic between platforms and creators.

## Unlock x Coinvise “Creator Cocktails” Happy Hour

On Wednesday night at ETHDenver, the Unlock team co-hosted over 150 registrants with our friends from Coinvise at the Rock Bottom Brewery to kick back and have some snacks, libations, and great conversations. 

The Locksmith community is absolute 🔥.
