Unlock is happy to announce the launch of Headline, bringing publishing and newsletter subscriptions into the Web3 ecosystem. You can check it out at [https://viaheadline.xyz](https://viaheadline.xyz).

Built by Unlock and [RaidGuild](https://www.raidguild.org/), Headline utilizes technology from [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network/), a decentralized data network bringing unlimited data to Web3 applications and [Lit Protocol](https://litprotocol.com/), a distributed network for encryption to set a new standard for subscription newsletters in Web3.

"Encrypted data and access control on the open and decentralized web lets creators create world class experiences for their fans, without having to rely on any web2 platform as a middle man. The composability of the open web, like how Lit Protocol and Unlock can work together, is in service of creating more value for creators and their fans," said David Sneider, CEO Lit Protocol

"We believe that the most successful Web3 projects are those building bridges across the ecosystem. Ceramic's open, decentralized data network is a natural fit for Headline, and we're excited to see how creators leverage this composable infrastructure to share their content across a multitude of communities and platforms," said Lauren Feld, Head of Business Development at 3Box Labs.

Online publishing platforms have proven time and time again to act with their own self-interest, imposing limitations on creators, such as onerous fees and other business-model decisions that benefit the platform and hinder the creators. A primary means of retaining users on these platforms is by locking members into the platform, rather than allowing creators to control those fan relationships directly. Unlock offers a new alternative for creators trapped inside the walled gardens of these Web2 platforms by enabling creators to directly manage who has access to their content, no matter where it's published.

With Headline, creators directly share their newsletters with readers who hold those creators' membership NFTs. This approach means creators don't need to rely on a third-party publication platform that forces readers to log into that site to access and subscribe to newsletters. Readers will retain the normal experience of having newsletters arrive in their inboxes, but for creators this represents a sea-change that gives them direct control and ownership over their newsletter membership.
