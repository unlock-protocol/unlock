<div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-hey-locksmiths">Hey Locksmiths!</h3></div><p>We've had another productive week at Unlock DAO, with significant developments across multiple fronts. Our recent DAO call was packed with updates that showcase our continued growth and the expanding impact of our protocol. Let's dive into the highlights!</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-protocol-optimizations-building-a-stronger-foundation">Protocol Optimizations: Building a Stronger Foundation</h3></div><p>Julien shared exciting news about recent protocol optimizations that are making a noticeable difference in performance. The team has made significant improvements to our RPC endpoints. These optimizations have resulted in a much faster web app experience, especially for users with multiple locks. Additionally, the team is working on a protocol upgrade that will enhance our swap and burn mechanism. This improvement will guarantee a more predictable outcome in terms of UP tokens being burnt, making the system more efficient and resistant to potential abuse. This upgrade is expected to be submitted to the DAO by the end of the month.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-eth-denver-aftermath-amplifying-our-presence">ETH Denver Aftermath: Amplifying Our Presence</h3></div><p>Following our successful participation at ETH Denver, we're now focused on leveraging the connections and content created during the event. We're planning a co-hosted livestream with Rachel OnChain, Hats Protocol, and Decent in the coming weeks, which will further amplify our message and showcase the collaborative spirit of our ecosystem. As Lead Steward, I have compiled a comprehensive report on our ETH Denver activities, which is now available on Charmverse. This report details our engagements, connections made, and lessons learned, providing valuable insights for future events. To better organize and utilize the numerous contacts made during ETH Denver, we're updating our CRM system in Charmverse. This will help us maintain and nurture these relationships, potentially leading to new partnerships, integrations and protocol adoptions.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-airdrop-success-rewarding-community-participation">Airdrop Success: Rewarding Community Participation</h3></div><p>Our recent airdrop has been gaining significant traction! When checked earlier this morning, we had already surpassed 300 claims. The airdrop targets over 10,000 addresses, distributing tokens to community members who have actively participated in governance, used the protocol for events or memberships, or contributed to our ecosystem in various ways. The visibility of our airdrop has been enhanced through its listing on Daylight, which has excellent distribution channels, including Coinbase Wallet. We encourage everyone to continue sharing and promoting the airdrop to ensure maximum reach and participation.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-token-listing-progress-expanding-our-reach">Token Listing Progress: Expanding Our Reach</h3></div><p>Manuel has been doing exceptional work on our token listing initiatives, as documented in Charmverse. His efforts have significantly advanced our token's visibility and accessibility. In recognition of his valuable contributions, we're planning to bring his quarterly payout to Tally for approval by the end of this month.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-liquidity-management-apebonds-and-dao-incentives">Liquidity Management: ApeBonds and DAO Incentives</h3></div><p>Danny is working on updates regarding the status of ApeBonds and DAO-provided liquidity incentives on our Uniswap pool. These initiatives are crucial for maintaining healthy liquidity for our token. While Danny was temporarily sidetracked by immigration issues in Rwanda, he assured us that both matters would be addressed before the end of the week.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-grant-hunting-securing-additional-resources">Grant Hunting: Securing Additional Resources</h3></div><p>We're actively seeking new grant opportunities to support our ongoing development and community initiatives. If you have contacts or ideas for potential grants, please share them with the DAO. Your input could help us secure valuable resources for our ecosystem's growth.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-march-social-media-focus-amplifying-our-message">March Social Media Focus: Amplifying Our Message</h3></div><p>This month, we're placing special emphasis on social media content creation. With the recent airdrop announcement, it's more important than ever to maintain a strong presence across platforms. Our team is dedicating additional resources to create and share engaging content that highlights the value and versatility of Unlock Protocol. We've established a dedicated social media posting group on Discord to streamline our content creation and distribution process. This group will help ensure consistent messaging and maximize our reach without overwhelming the main server channels.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-ninja-promo-marketing-navigating-administrative-challenges">Ninja Promo Marketing: Navigating Administrative Challenges</h3></div><p>Our planned collaboration with Ninja Promo has raised some administrative questions regarding contract signing. Since the DAO is not incorporated, we're exploring options for handling this web2 requirement. We're considering whether the foundation could potentially handle this aspect or if alternative arrangements need to be made. Julia from Ninja Promo has requested company data for invoice processing. We're consulting with legal advisors to determine the most appropriate approach while maintaining compliance with relevant regulations.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-historic-milestone-unlock-protocol-in-the-peruvian-congress">Historic Milestone: Unlock Protocol in the Peruvian Congress</h3></div><p>We're thrilled to announce that Unlock Protocol was used at the Peruvian Congress, marking what appears to be our first implementation in a governmental context. This represents a significant milestone for our protocol and demonstrates its potential for adoption beyond traditional web3 applications. During an official meeting, the Peruvian Congress received 10 certifications from Unlock Protocol on-chain. This breakthrough opens doors for potential collaborations with other public sector entities and showcases the versatility and legitimacy of our technology. An organization focused on blockchain is forming in Peru, and we're exploring opportunities to support and engage with this emerging community. This development aligns perfectly with our mission to expand the adoption of decentralized access control across diverse sectors and regions.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-role-design-progress-visual-identity-for-our-organization">Role Design Progress: Visual Identity for Our Organization</h3></div><p>Leah Sams has shared her mood board for our role-related membership NFT designs. These designs will visually represent our organizational structure and roles within the Hats Protocol integration. We encourage all community members, especially those tagged in the Discord thread, to review and provide feedback on these initial concepts. Your input at this stage is crucial for ensuring the final designs accurately reflect our community's identity and values. The mood board represents the foundation of this creative process, and your feedback will help shape the direction of these important visual assets.</p><p>As we continue to build and grow, your active participation remains essential to our success. Whether it's providing feedback on role designs, promoting our airdrop, or contributing to our social media presence, every action helps strengthen our community and advance our mission.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-stay-unlocked">Stay Unlocked!</h3></div><p>Your Lead Steward</p><p>Stella</p><hr><p><strong>Important links</strong></p><ul><li><p>Check out Unlock Protocol for yourself: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://unlock-protocol.com/">https://unlock-protocol.com/</a></p></li><li><p>Join us for our recurring and unique events: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://app.unlock-protocol.com/events/unlock-dao-events-2025">https://app.unlock-protocol.com/events/unlock-dao-events-2025</a></p></li><li><p>Vote for Unlock DAO Proposals offchain: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://snapshot.box/#/s:unlock-dao.ethï¿¼Vote">https://snapshot.box/#/s:unlock-dao.eth</a></p></li><li><p>Vote for Unlock DAO Proposals onchain: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://www.tally.xyz/gov/unlock-protocol">https://www.tally.xyz/gov/unlock-protocol</a></p></li><li><p>Join the Unlock DAO Collaborative space on Charmverse: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://app.charmverse.io/join?domain=unlock-dao">https://app.charmverse.io/join?domain=unlock-dao</a></p></li></ul><p></p>
