<p>This year marked the first time Unlock Protocol debuted as a DAO at ETH Denver. We are proud and grateful to the community members who attended and represented the protocol!

With this short report, we aim to show our personal key highlights, shed some light on the sponsored events, mention some of the more significant contacts we established, and share our lessons learned that will see active implementation into upcoming events. Let's get started!</p><h2 id="h-key-highlights" class="text-3xl font-header"><strong>Key Highlights </strong></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Investment and Impact</strong>: The DAO invested 4 ETH + $3,342.94, onboarding approximately 1,500 new users to the protocol (potentially more).</p></li><li><p><strong>Event Sponsorships</strong>: Unlock Protocol DAO sponsored several side events, including Carrot Castle, Hats &amp; Friends, and the Onchain Creator Summit. Unlock Labs sponsored Pizza Castle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brand Visibility</strong>: The DAO achieved strong visibility among target groups: community organizers, creators, and fellow builders.</p></li></ul><h2 id="h-sponsored-events" class="text-3xl font-header">Sponsored Events</h2><p>As mentioned, this year marks the first year in the DAO's history that many people within the DAO organized ETH Denver, not just Unlock Labs team members. The following events were sponsored with interesting results, each targeting a slightly different group of Protocol Users.</p><h3 id="h-carrot-castle" class="text-2xl font-header"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://app.unlock-protocol.com/event/carrot-castle-knight-nibbles-a-lot"><strong>Carrot Castle</strong></a></h3><p>This week-long think tank on governance and community organization attracted over 120 visitors despite being located outside Denver's city center. The event allowed stellaachenbach to showcase Unlock Protocol's potential in creating memberships, events, and certifications for decentralized communities and their educational initiatives.</p><h3 id="h-pizza-castle" class="text-2xl font-header"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://app.unlock-protocol.com/event/pizza-castle-4">Pizza Castle</a></h3><p>Pizza DAO held an evening event on February 26th at Spork Castle, with over one thousand people attending throughout the evening. The event itself can be classified as a networking initiative that brings people together from various parts of the blockchain world. </p><h3 id="h-hats-and-friends" class="text-2xl font-header"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://app.unlock-protocol.com/event/hats-friends"><strong>Hats &amp; Friends</strong></a></h3><p>Co-sponsored with aligned projects like Hats Protocol, Decent DAO, Lemma, and Tally, this event drew 173 RSVPs and featured notable Web3 personalities. The gathering facilitated valuable networking and project discussions, leading to closer network collaborations. </p><h3 id="h-onchain-creator-summit" class="text-2xl font-header"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://app.unlock-protocol.com/event/onchain-creator-summit"><strong>Onchain Creator Summit</strong></a></h3><p>This creator-centric event in Denver's art district highlighted the need for better preparation from our side to showcase Unlock Protocol's capabilities for creators properly. The summit showcased a healthy mix of creators, organizers and builders. We lacked preparation and clarity for this event to take maximum advantage of our presence there.</p><p>Other projects made it onto our&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://app.unlock-protocol.com/events/eth-denver-2025">ETH Denver 2025 Collection</a>&nbsp;list, but the goal would be to triple the number of events (not necessarily sponsorships) throughout this year!</p><h2 id="h-networking-and-future-opportunities" class="text-3xl font-header"><strong>Networking and Future Opportunities</strong></h2><p>Thanks to many DAO members making an appearance at ETH Denver, we were able to split across different events, forming or deepening valuable connections for the DAO. The complete CRM additions can be reviewed within the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://app.charmverse.io/unlock-dao/eth-denver-2025-summary-40367222489665644">Unlock DAO Charmverse</a> space for those who are interested. </p><p>stellaachenbach took most of last week to have various follow-up meetings, and things look promising! The added connections open doors for potential collaborations, integrations, and expanded use of Unlock Protocol by our core target groups.</p><h2 id="h-lessons-learned" class="text-3xl font-header"><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></h2><p>Thanks to the participation in ETH Denver this year and spending some funds, the DAO could learn and make any future iteration better than the one before. The following points have been identified as areas of improvement:</p><ul class="task-list" data-type="taskList"><li class="task-list-item" data-checked="" data-type="taskItem"><label><input type="checkbox" checked="checked"><span></span></label><div><p>Improve social media presence during events with a streamlined process that lets attendees and fellow DAO members who stayed back seamlessly collaborate on social media content. As an attendee, it is impossible to generate social content; hence, other DAO members will have to pick up the slack.</p></div></li><li class="task-list-item" data-checked="" data-type="taskItem"><label><input type="checkbox" checked="checked"><span></span></label><div><p>Rework the grant process to dictate what we need as a DAO from grantees. Unlock Protocol is free and open-source and can empower many people and their business models. The DAO must rethink how grants are being given and what the return exactly needs to look like.</p></div></li><li class="task-list-item" data-checked="" data-type="taskItem"><label><input type="checkbox" checked="checked"><span></span></label><div><p>Develop more elaborate merchandise for DAO members that will attract and create a brand narrative across different side events.</p></div></li><li class="task-list-item" data-checked="" data-type="taskItem"><label><input type="checkbox" checked="checked"><span></span></label><div><p>Further strengthening alignments with other projects for increased visibility at the event and collaborating on more initiatives to knit us together tightly.</p></div></li></ul><h2 id="h-action-items" class="text-3xl font-header">Action Items</h2><p>Since the event, several action items have been added to our members' agenda. These are the most important ones:</p><ul class="task-list" data-type="taskList"><li class="task-list-item" data-checked="" data-type="taskItem"><label><input type="checkbox" checked="checked"><span></span></label><div><p>Write up an in-depth DAO <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://app.charmverse.io/unlock-dao/eth-denver-2025-summary-40367222489665644">report on Charmverse</a></p></div></li><li class="task-list-item" data-checked="" data-type="taskItem"><label><input type="checkbox" checked="checked"><span></span></label><div><p>Synthesize the complete report into a newsletter format (here we are <span data-name="wink" class="emoji" data-type="emoji">ðŸ˜‰</span>)</p></div></li><li class="task-list-item" data-checked="" data-type="taskItem"><label><input type="checkbox" checked="checked"><span></span></label><div><p>A co-hosted livestream with Hats Protocol and Decent DAO to recap ETH Denver 2025.
