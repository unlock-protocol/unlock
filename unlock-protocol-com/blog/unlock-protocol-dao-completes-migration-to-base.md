<p>Unlock Protocol has always been committed to providing an open-source, decentralized solution for onchain memberships, subscriptions, ticketing, and certifications. As the Unlock Locksmith developer base, user base, and community expanded, the limitations of governing the Unlock Protocol DAO on Ethereum mainnet became more apparent, particularly concerning transaction costs.</p><p>To address these challenges, members of the Unlock Protocol DAO proposed a migration to Base in 2024 with a new token (UP), new governor and timelock contracts, treasury and smart contract ownership transfers, and a number of other required supporting initiatives.</p><p>These activities have now been completed.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h2 id="h-migration-process">Migration Process</h2></div><p>The migration to Base was a comprehensive process that involved several critical steps:</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-deployment-of-a-new-unlock-protocol-up-governance-token">Deployment of a new Unlock Protocol (UP) governance token</h3></div><p>The creation of the Unlock Protocol (UP) governance token on Base was a crucial step in the migration process.</p><p>This new token (UP) is the primary governance mechanism for the Unlock Protocol DAO on Base. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover" href="https://basescan.org/token/0xac27fa800955849d6d17cc8952ba9dd6eaa66187">UP token</a> incorporates improved tokenomics, aimed at fostering greater participation and alignment among community members.</p><p>Its deployment involved careful consideration of factors such as total supply, initial distribution, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover" href="https://paragraph.xyz/@unlockprotocol/bridge-earn">reward schedules</a> to ensure fairness and long-term sustainability.</p><p>The UP token was created by the Unlock Protocol Foundation.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-deployment-of-governance-smart-contracts-on-base"><strong>Deployment of governance smart contracts on Base</strong></h3></div><p>Previously, the Unlock Protocol governor contracts were deployed on Ethereum mainnet.

(In order to eliminate potential confusion between the two tokens, a different name — UP — was chosen on Base.)</p><p>Existing UDT holders are able to exchange their UDT for UP tokens at a 1-to-1000 ratio, as a result of the different supplies of the two tokens. Every UDT token swapped receives 1,000 UP tokens in return and may be eligible to receive additional bonuses.</p><p>At swap-time, UDT holders are also directed to explicitly delegate their voting power for their new UP tokens, in service of the goal of active participation in the Unlock DAO. Individuals are able to self-delegate (i.e., vote their own tokens). If an individual wishes to hold the UP token but delegate their votes to another member of the community, they are able to do so.</p><p>The swapping of UDT for UP is handled by a swapping smart contract. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover" href="https://paragraph.xyz/@unlockprotocol/bridge-earn">Full details on the swapping smart contract and swap process can be viewed here</a>.</p><p>The Unlock Labs team has created a website at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" class="dont-break-out" href="https://up-swap.unlock-protocol.com/">https://up-swap.unlock-protocol.com/</a> where anyone holding UDT can bridge their UDT from mainnet to Base and swap that UDT for UP governance tokens.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-movement-of-the-unlock-dao-treasury-to-base">Movement of the Unlock DAO treasury to Base</h3></div><p>As the migration neared completion, the members of the Unlock Protocol DAO <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover" href="https://www.tally.xyz/gov/unlock/proposal/64670389037077777251794002149940005202484368028371335521334825123900835628184?govId=eip155:1:0x440d9D4E66d39bb28FB58729Cb4D3ead2A595591">moved the UDT governance tokens in the DAO’s treasury on mainnet to Base</a>, and then <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dont-break-out notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover" href="https://www.tally.xyz/gov/unlock-protocol/proposal/63269785253077722766136849401328655272413685934436217551731159324075983360350">swapped that UDT for UP tokens on Base</a>.</p><div class="relative header-and-anchor"><h3 id="h-changed-ownership-of-the-unlock-contracts-from-the-unlock-dao-on-mainnet-to-the-unlock-dao-on-base">Changed ownership of the Unlock contracts from the Unlock DAO on mainnet to the Unlock DAO on Base</h3></div><p>Unlock Protocol is a community-governed protocol.
