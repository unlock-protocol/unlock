# Unlock Documentation

[Unlock](https://unlock-protocol.com) is an **access control protocol** that enables creators 
to monetize their work directly - without relying on a middleman.

Consumers manage all of their subscriptions in a consistent way, as well as earn discounts when 
they share the best content and applications they use.

It's all built on a blockchain, so it's decentralized and free to use forever.
