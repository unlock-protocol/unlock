## Contributing

First of all, thank you! First, you need to have `git` installed on your machine. Then, create a fork of the main Unlock repo, located at [`https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock`](https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock). For this, you should follow [the steps provided by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

Once cloned, using the terminal type `yarn` and `yarn build` at the root of the repository.

After this, you're ready. You can hop into the `docs` folder and there, you can use the `yarn run  start` to build an serve the docs from your local machine.

Then do the changes you want to introduce to the docs (in the `docs` folder). Once you are done, make sure your changes are rendered as you expect them to be!

Finally, you need to commit changes, and push them to Github. Once that is done you can [open a Pull-Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) against the main Unlock repository!
