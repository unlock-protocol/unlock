  Querying smart contracts directly from your application is always an option,
  but, when your application needs to retrieve large collections or multiple
  elements from a contract, use our subgraph!

# Unlock Subgraph Introduction

Unlock has a GraphQL API Endpoint hosted by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction#what-the-graph-is) called a subgraph for indexing and organizing data from the Unlock smart contracts.

Unlock leverages the [Graph Protocol](https://thegraph.com) to simplify the process of making meaningful applications leveraging the Unlock Smart Contracts and associated data.

### Endpoints

The links below provide a rudimentary tool to build and test your queries.

<ul>
  {Object.keys(networks).map((network) => {
    if (network !== 'localhost') {
      const endpoint = networks[network].subgraph.endpointV2
      console.log(endpoint)
      const m = endpoint.match(/unlock\-protocol\/(.*)/)
      return (
        <li>
          <a
            href={
              m && m[1]
                ? `https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/unlock-protocol/${m[1]}`
                : endpoint
            }
          >
            {networks[network].name}
          </a>
        </li>
      )
    }
  })}
</ul>
