# Dashboard

The [Unlock Dashboard](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/dashboard) is not 
properly speaking a developer tool but it is a convenient tool to manage your 
locks and keys. 

Let's take a look at some of the functionality!

## Locks

### Deploying

You can deploy a lock from the Dashboard in just a few minutes with just a few
clicks. Take a look at the [step-by-step guide.](https://unlock-protocol.com/guides/how-to-create-a-lock/)

### Updating Lock Settings
Locks deployed from anywhere, even other applications, can be managed with the 
Dashboard as long as you have the Lock Manager role. Nearly all functions 
available via the contract interfaces can be handled in the user interface.

### Creating Checkout (minting) Experiences
The Dashboard "Checkout Builder" allows you to create customized minting
experiences. Much like the PayPal or Stripe checkout, you can customize the look
and feel, upload a logo, label and collect additional information from the end
user. You can download a link or the JSON configuration file needed for
setting up the [Paywall](/tools/paywall).

### Managing Stripe
Unlock Protocol has built a system which works with Stripe to help reduce friction
for your end users who do not already have web3 wallets. You can manage your 
Stripe account connection from the [Dashboard](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/).

### Referral / Platform Fees
Managing [referral and platform fees](https://unlock-protocol.com/blog/referral-fees) can be done from this UI also, which comes
in handy if you have a large affiliate network helping to promote your project,
subscriptions or tickets.

### Managing Roles
You can add Lock Managers who will then be able to see and manage locks when 
they login to the [Dashboard](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/). Additionally, if
you're using Unlock for ticketing you can add verifiers who will then be able
to use the [Verification page](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/verification) to 
check people in at events.

## Keys

### Airdropping Keys
We have tools available for airdropping which will allow you to do one at a time
or in bulk, you can even upload a CSV file. Go check out the [step-by-step guide.](https://unlock-protocol.com/guides/how-to-airdrop-memberships/) 

### Editing NFT (Key) Properties & Issuing Refunds
Managing keys can also be done from the [Dashboard](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/)
whether you need to mark a ticket as checked in, add an email address to a
DAO member or refund a subscription membership, it's all possible through the UI.

### Downloading a Member List
If you need to export a list of your members, you can so by downloading a CSV file
from the [Dashboard](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/).

## Keys / Member Keychain
The member keychain is a place where you can see which keys your wallet address
owns across all locks on all networks. This is handy for checking metadata and asking
for refunds or adding them to your wallet. This is also a way to help your own users
understand how to see and interact with their membership NFTs, too.
