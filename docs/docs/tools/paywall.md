# Paywall

The Paywall is a simple JavaScript library which can track state and emits
events based on ownership of keys to specified locks. It can be used to trigger
a the Checkout for purchasing keys.

You can easily add it to any webpage with the following:

```javascript
<script>
(function(d, s) {
  var js = d.createElement(s),
    sc = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
  js.src="https://paywall.unlock-protocol.com/static/unlock.latest.min.js";
  sc.parentNode.insertBefore(js, sc); }(document, "script"));
</script>
```

## Configuration

The Paywall shares a configuration object with the Checkout and you can find
everything you need to know in [Checkout / Configuration](/tools/checkout/configuration#the-paywallconfig-object) about how to build
out the JSON object you're going use. Then assign it to a global variable `unlockProtocolConfig`.

```javascript
<script>
  var unlockProtocolConfig =
  {
    // paywallConfig object
  }
</script>
```

## Events

Once loaded the script will trigger events on the page’s ​window​ object.

Registering event listeners.

```javascript
window.addEventListener("unlockProtocol.eventName", handler);
```

| lock | the Ethereum address of the lock | _string_ |

### User metadata

**event** `unlockProtocol.metadata`

Sent collected metadata about all the recipients. This is triggered on confirmation of the transaction.

## Pessimistic Unlocking

One of the features of the paywall application is that it [optimistically unlocks the page](https://unlock-protocol.com/blog/hello-optimistic-unlocking/). This feature improves the customer experience by immediately emitting the `unlocked` event when a transaction is sent, as long as the transaction is likely enough to eventually succeed.

In some cases, your application may want to _not_ unlock until the transaction is fully confirmed. For this you should add `pessimistic: true` to the paywall configuration.

When doing this, you should ensure that your application handles the events such as `unlockProtocol.authenticated` and `unlockProtocol.transactionSent` to show valuable feedback to the user. See the ["Events"](#events) section on this page.
