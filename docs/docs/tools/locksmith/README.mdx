description: Summary of the Locksmith service, a development tool for Unlock Protocol.
---

Locksmith is a hosted API service providing an array of functionality which are not part of the core protocol, but are useful to build applications or onboard users. These tools can (and should!) be replaced by 3rd party applications who want to implement the protocol natively.

Locksmith powers the following functionality at the moment:

- Store metadata for locks, keys, and users
- Automated NFT membership renewals
- Fiat payment integration
- Ticket management
- Webhooks triggered when keys and locks are created
- Sending emails, generating QR codes, and other miscellanous tasks.

## Authorization Strategy

Several endpoints are protected and require authentication.

We use signed [SIWE](https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361) message to issue token for authentication. You will need to sign message using [siwe](https://docs.ssx.id/) library and send the signed message to the server. The server will verify the signature and issue a token for the user. You will receive a token with short expiry duration which needs to be passed in the header as bearer token for all subsequent requests. The other is refresh token which is used to get a new token when the current token expires.

If you are creating applications using JavaScript, you can use `LocksmithService` from the `@unlock-protocol/unlock-js` to interact with Locksmith API. The following is an example of how to use it to send a login request.

```ts
import { LocksmithService } from '@unlock-protocol/unlock-js'

const service = new LocksmithService()

// Creates a SIWE message to be signed
const siwe = LocksmithService.createSiweMessage({
  domain: 'your-app.com',
  uri: 'https://your-app.com',
  address: '0x123...', // Address of the account that is trying to connect
  chainId: network, // ChainId of the network (use 1 by default)
  version: '1', // Version of the Siwe message (use '1' by default)
})

// Get message text to be signed
const message = siwe.prepareMessage()

// Sign the message
// The wallet object here is an ethers wallet
const signature = wallet.signMessage(message)

const loginResponse = await service.login({
  message,
  signature,
})

// Use the token to make subsequent requests in the header as bearer token using axios middleware and refresh or re-login when the session expires.
const { accessToken, walletAddress, refreshToken } = loginResponse.data

// Get key metadata from locksmith. If the request is authenticated, you will also receive protected metadata for the key and associated user.
const keyResponse = await storage.keyMetadata(5, '0x', '1', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
  },
})

console.log(keyResponse.data) // This will show the metadata for the key, including the protected fields with the owner's metadata.
```
