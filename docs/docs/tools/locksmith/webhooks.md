# Webhooks

Locksmith implements [Websub](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub) which allows anyone to receive real time updates from the [Unlock subgraphs]. It is a _webhook_ system which many developers will be familiar with with built-in intent verification.

Currently, locksmith support sending updates on new locks and keys. To subscribe, an application will need to send a post request to the hubs located at `/api/hooks/[topic]`. The body needs to match the schema specified in the [Websub w3c spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#x5-1-subscriber-sends-subscription-request).

For examples on using the webhooks checkout the tutorial ["Using Webhooks with the Locksmith API"](../../tutorials/back-end/locksmith-webhooks.md).

Currently the following topics are supported: 

- New Locks `https://locksmith.unlock-protocol.com/api/hooks/:network/locks`
- New Keys `https://locksmith.unlock-protocol.com/api/hooks/:network/keys` 
- New Keys for a Lock `https://locksmith.unlock-protocol.com/api/hooks/:network/locks/:lock/keys`

You need to replace `network` and `lock` with the respective network ID and Lock Address.
