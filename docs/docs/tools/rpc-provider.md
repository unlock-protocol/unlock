# RPC Providers

For development purposes, Unlock Labs offers a set of RPC providers that you can use, for each of the networks that we support.
These RPC providers are all using the same syntax: `https://rpc.unlock-protocol.com/<chainId>` where `chainId` is the id of the network you want to use (`1` is for Ethereum mainnet... etc).

You can check our [Networks](/core-protocol/unlock/networks) page to see the network that we currently support.

Each of the library that we offer comes pre-configured with these RPC providers, but can also be configured to change these.

**In production, you should _always_ use your own RPC providers.**
