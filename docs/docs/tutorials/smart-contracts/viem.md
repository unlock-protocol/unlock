# Using Unlock Protocol's contract with Viem

Unlock's smart contracts are no different from any other contract and you should be able to use [`viem`](https://viem.sh/) with both the [Unlock](../../core-protocol/unlock/) contract (to deploy new locks) and the [Public Lock](../../core-protocol/public-lock/) membership contracts.

To get the ABI, you can use `@unlock-protocol/contracts` and `@unlock-protocol/networks` to get the Unlock contracts addresses.
