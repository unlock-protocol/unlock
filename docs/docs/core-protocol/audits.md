As of March 2022, our smart contracts have been audited by 3 different teams.

Here are the results:

We are pleased with the results of these audits as they have identified **no issue that would jeopardize creators or members' funds systemically**. The audits did identify improvements that we have implemented to simplify flows, make risky behaviors less error-prone, and optimize for reduced gas consumption.
