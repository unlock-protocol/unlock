Every transaction that includes a transfer of value between a purchaser and the Public Lock smart contracts includes a `referrer` parameter:

- [`purchase`](/core-protocol/smart-contracts-api/PublicLock#purchase)
- [`extend`](/core-protocol/smart-contracts-api/PublicLock#extend)
- [`renewMembershipFor`](/core-protocol/smart-contracts-api/PublicLock#renewmembershipfor)

The referrer can optionally receive a share of the price paid by the purchaser.

### Setting a referrer fee

A lock manager can call the `setReferrerFee` function on the Public Lock contract to set a specific referrer fee for a given address. This function takes 2 arguments. The first one is the address of a `referrer` and the second one is the referrer fee percentage, expressed in basis points.

As such, the lock manager can set multiple referrer fees for various referrers. For example a given referrer could receive 10% of the price paid, while another one could receive 30%.

Finally, if the lock manager sets a referrer fee for the `0x0` address (the zero address), then the referrer fee will apply to _any_ referrer address.

It is possible to query a contract to identity the referrer fee set for a specific address by querying the `referrerFees` function.

### Examples
