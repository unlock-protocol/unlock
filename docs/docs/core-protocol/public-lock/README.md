# Public Lock

A "Lock" (`PublicLock.sol`) is a customized smart contract for minting (creating) ERC-721 NFT's. They are the Unlock Protocol version of a "minting contract". They are created with the [Unlock](../../core-protocol/unlock/) smart contract, which is a "factory" contract. That factory contract uses the [Public Lock](../../core-protocol/public-lock/) template contact along with
with the configuration options you choose to record a new customized
smart contract to the blockchain [network](../../core-protocol/unlock/networks) of your choice.

Each lock is a standalone contract with its own deployment, address, and storage.

- Each lock contract is an [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) compliant contract capable of creating and managing NFTs (non-fungible tokens we call "Keys"), as well as restricting access based on the user's possession (or lack of) one of these keys.
- Keys for one lock are valid only for the lock which created them.
- A given user may own only 1 key (NFT) at a time as a default, but that can be changed using the `setMaxKeysPerAddress` function.

Addittionaly, the Lock smart contract has multiple capabilities:

- _Administrative_: these are the functions which change rights (see[ access control](./access-control/)) associated to the lock or individual parameters for the lock a such as its name or of course its price. Finally, there is a method to withdraw funds from the lock contract itself.
- _Transferring key ownership_: keys can be purchased from the lock smart contract itself or from another user who purchased one previously. Another element is that keys can be purchased on behalf of somebody else \(this is important because this lets somebody pay gas fees on behalf of somebody else\)
- _Changing key attributes_: the keys have an expiration date which can be changed \(for an earlier date by the lock owner\) as well as data attributes which can be changed to something else.

## Interacting with Protocol Contracts

Here are some popular JavaScript libaries that can be used to interact with blockchain smart contracts including [Unlock.sol](../../core-protocol/unlock/).

- [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/)
- [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/)

Tools we've built and maintain can be found in the ["Tools"](../../tools/) section of the docs. The following tools can be used for deploying locks.

- [Unlock.js](../../tools/unlock.js) is our JavaScript library for interacting with the protocol. It can be used with node.js on the back-end or on the front-end in the browser. This is the library used by our Dashboard and front-end applications.

- [Unlock Hardhat Plugin](../../tutorials/smart-contracts/deploying-locally) can be used to deploy locally. The plugin includes both tasks that can be added to your own hardhat script, or a cli.

You can call and inspect the Lock contracts directly using the block explorers as well.

## Upgrades and customization

All locks deployed (version 10 and later) are upgradable by their lock manager, through the Unlock contract.

Lock managers can also alter the behavior of their locks thru the use of [hooks](./hooks/).

## Changelog

Changelogs can be found here for the last two versions.

### Version 13

**Released**: April 2023

This new version improved gas consumption of most functions (by using Solidity custom errors instead of require statements). It solves issues that were appearing when canceling or burning membership keys. 

The helpers functions `addKeyGranter` and `isKeyGranter` have been removed to reduce the size of the contract. The features are still accessible by calling directly `grantRole` and `hasRole` with `keccak256('KEY_GRANTER_ROLE')` as role.

The following feature has been introduced:

#### `isRenewable`

Easily check if a key is ready for renewal

### Version 12

**Released**: October 2022

The following are the signifigant changes and a full list of commits including bug fixes can be found [here](https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock/issues?q=+label%3A%22publicLock+v12%22+).

#### `onGrantKeyHook` and `onKeyExtendHook`

This allows for registration of custom functionality when keys are granted and when keys are renewed or extended.

#### `setLockMetadata`

The various features to set metadata (name, symbol and tokenURIs) have been regrouped into this single function.

#### `updateLockConfig`

The configuration for a keyâ€™s default duration and available quantity (both per user and in aggregate) have also been grouped into this single function.

#### `expirationTimestamp`

This adds the expiration timestamp on ExpirationDuration event emitted by the time machine when time gets added or substracted to/from a key.

#### Events and schema changes

Added a new event `LockConfig`
Added `maxNumberOfKeys` and `maxKeysPerAddress` to the lock schema
Added `expirationTimestamp` to `ExpirationChanged` event

### Version 11

**Released**: August 2022

This new version brings a lot of gas savings as well as a few minor bug fixes. It also introduces the following features:

#### `referrerFees` and `setReferrerFee`

This is the most important addition to the protocol in this version. `referrerFees` are ways for a lock manager to share their income with the `referrer` when a purchase is made (when calling `purchase`, `renewMembershipFor`, or `extend`). The fee is set as a percentage in basis points (`1000` is 10%).

A lock manager can call `setReferrerFee` to set specific fees for different referers. It is possible to set a _default_ fee for _any_ referrer by passing the Zero address as the referrer when calling `setReferrerFee`.

The function `referrerFees(address)` can be used to retrieve the fees set for a specific address.

#### `lendKey` and `unlendKey`

These 2 functions can be used by a key manager to lend a key or recover it. They can only be called by the key manager or current owner of the key if no manager is set. `lendKey(from, recipient, tokenId)` will set the caller as the new key manager (see [roles](./access-control.md)), and will transfer ownership of the key to the `recipient` address. `unlendKey(recipient, tokenId)` will transfer the key to the recipient.

#### `grantKeyExtension`

This new function is to `extend` what `grantKeys` is to the `purchase` function: it lets a key granter (see roles) or lock manager change the expiration of a specific key.
Unlock Labs uses this function to perform renewals on keys purchased via credit cards.

#### `onKeyTransferHook`

This version introduces a new [hook](./hooks.md) that is invoked when a key is transferred. The hook is called with the following parameters:
The hook is the final step in the transfer function.

- address of the lock
- token id to be transferred
- operator (address of the caller)
- previous owner address
- new owner address
- expiration timestamp of the key

#### `totalKeys`

This function returns the total number of keys on the lock for a specific address.
Note: `balanceOf` will return only the number of _valid_ (non-expired) in order to stay compatible with token gating tools.
