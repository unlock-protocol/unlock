# Networks

You should **not need to deploy an Unlock contract yourself**. Here are the addresses of contracts deployed on respective networks and you can call them directly using the block explorer.

The core team has built a `networks` [npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@unlock-protocol/networks) that includes all the networks' addresses as well as [rpc endpoints](../../tools/rpc-provider.md) that you can use for debugging purposes: `@unlock-protocol/networks`.

  {Object.values(networks).map((network) => (
    <SupportedNetwork network={network} />
  ))}
