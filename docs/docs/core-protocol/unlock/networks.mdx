# Networks

You should **not need to deploy an Unlock contract yourself**. Here are the addresses of contracts deployed on respective networks and you can call them directly using the block explorer.

The core team has built a `networks` [npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@unlock-protocol/networks) that includes all the networks' addresses as well as [rpc endpoints](../../tools/rpc-provider.md) that you can use for debugging purposes: `@unlock-protocol/networks`.

Object.values(networks).map((network) => {
  if (network.name === 'localhost') {
    return null
  }
return (
<div key={network.id}>
<h2>{network.name}</h2>
<p>{network.description}</p>
<ul>
  <li>chain id: {network.id}</li>
  <li>native currency: {network.nativeCurrency.name} ({network.nativeCurrency.symbol})</li>
  <li>Unlock address: <code><a href={network.explorer.urls.address(network.unlockAddress)}>{network.unlockAddress}</a></code></li>
</ul>
</div>
);
})
