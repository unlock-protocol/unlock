# Glossary

Welcome, Locksmith! Let’s start with getting the lay of the land with a few common terms you’ll see across the Unlock ecosystem.

<dl>
  <dt>Crypto Wallet</dt>
    <dd>A digital wallet to hold your currencies, collectibles (eg, NTFs), and 
    used to log into dApps (example: Metamask, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet)</dd>

  <dt>DAO</dt>
    <dd>Acronym for Decentralized Autonomous Organization</dd>

  <dt>dApp</dt>
    <dd>Short for decentralized application.</dd>
            
  <dt>Dashboard</dt>
    <dd>A web app built by Unlock Labs for creating "Locks", managing "Keys", 
      and more.</dd>

  <dt>DeFi</dt>
    <dd>Short for decentralized finance.</dd>

  <dt>DYOR</dt>
    <dd>Do your own research. Another way to say "don't take my word for it".</dd>

  <dt>Factory Contract</dt>
    <dd>A factory contract is a particular type of smart contract that creates other smart contracts.</dd>

  <dt>Key</dt>
    <dd>In the Unlock ecosystem, a “Key” is an NFT (minted by a Lock) that has 
    additional features added to it to facilitate the management of memberships, 
    such as an expiration date.</dd>
  
  <dt>Key Manager</dt>
    <dd>An assigned title set on an Unlock key which gives a specific wallet
    address authorization to transfer, share or cancel.</dd>

  <dt>Lock</dt>
    <dd>In the Unlock ecosystem, a “Lock” is a smart contract that creates 
    (or “mints”) NFTs. Locks also can be used to ensure “members-only” access 
    to resources like online content, live events, online certifications, or 
    other “members-only” experiences.</dd>
  
  <dt>Lock Manager</dt>
    <dd>An assigned <a href="/core-protocol/public-lock/access-control#roles">role </a>
    set on a Lock contract which gives the highest level of permissions to the 
    wallet address set to that role.</dd>
  
  <dt>Locksmith</dt>
    <dd>The name of the API backend service built by the Unlock Labs team and which offers optional features such as metadata-hosting, credit card payments...  It is also how we sometimes call community member or builder in the Unlock ecosystem. </dd>

  <dt>Membership</dt>
    <dd>A membership is a connection between a creator, brand or project and a 
    fan or community member. A membership usual confers benefits or special access 
    to those who hold it. Members can also connect directly with each other.</dd>

  <dt>NFT</dt>
    <dd>An NFT (or “non-fungible token”) is a specific kind of digital asset that 
    is unique and can’t be duplicated or counterfeited. NFTs are uniquely suited 
    to act as “digital membership cards.”</dd>

  <dt>Paywall</dt>
    <dd><a href="/tools/checkout/paywall/">The Paywall</a> is a web application which 
    provides a user interface allowing people to purchase keys to given locks and 
    easily lock or unlock content on a web page based on the ownership of those 
    keys.</dd>
  
  <dt>Protocol</dt>
    <dd>A protocol is an open-source collection of code that typically solves a 
    specific problem (e.g. transferring information online or, in Unlock’s case, 
    creating and managing memberships and subscriptions). Most notably, open-source 
    protocols can be used by anyone without the need to ask for permission and can 
    be combined with other protocols (in the same manner as LEGO bricks) to create 
    more sophisticated systems.</dd>

  <dt>Platform</dt>
    <dd>A “platform” is a set of online services. In stark contrast to open 
    protocols, a platform is often owned or managed by a corporation or other 
    entity that can change its terms of use, functionality, or access at any time. 
    Platforms can make changes without user consent or involvement.</dd>

  <dt>Referrer</dt>
    <dd>An assigned role on an Unlock "Lock" contract which is a wallet address
    who will receive a portion of membership income. Can be used for many 
    different <a href="https://unlock-protocol.com/blog/referral-fees">monetization</a> options such as affiliate or platform fees.</dd>
  
  <dt>Smart Contract</dt>
    <dd>A smart contract is a piece of code that is deployed and runs on a blockchain. Smart contracts are executable programs.</dd>

  <dt>Subscription</dt>
    <dd>A subscription is a recurring or renewable membership that has a time 
    component to it. After expiration, the subscription (and therefore the access 
    to membership benefits) expires.</dd>

  <dt>UDT</dt>
    <dd>Unlock Discount Token which is granted as rewards upon key purchase to 
    an address designated in the key purchase call. Currently used for  
    <a href="/governance/"> governance</a> votes.</dd>

  <dt>web3</dt>
    <dd>The next stage of the internet, following Web 2.0, which is more 
decentralized and built with blockchain and other decentralized networks.</dd>
