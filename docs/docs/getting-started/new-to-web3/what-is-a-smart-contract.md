Ethereum development environments like [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/tutorial) make it easier to work with smart contracts and Ethereum nodes. Hardhat is a development environment that helps developers compile, deploy, debug, and test their Ethereum applications. Hardhat has many plugins, which further increases its functionality.

[Unlock Protocol has created a Hardhat library](https://docs.unlock-protocol.com/core-protocol/deploying-locally/) that speeds development using the protocol.
