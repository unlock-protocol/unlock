# What is Unlock Protocol?

Unlock is a protocol developers, creators, and platforms can use to create
memberships. Unlock’s goal is to ease implementation and increase conversion
from “users” to “members,” creating a much healthier monetization environment
for the web.

In short, Unlock is an open-source, collectively owned, community-governed,
peer-to-peer system that creates time-based memberships.

There are a number of interdependent components of Unlock. These are:

- **Unlock Labs:** The core team that created and currently maintains Unlock
Protocol.
- **Unlock Protocol:** A suite of upgradable smart contracts that create
memberships as NFTs.
- **The Unlock Ecosystem:** A community of creators, distributors, and consumers
who share ownership of Unlock Protocol through their contributions using the
protocol.
- **[Unlock DAO](../../governance/unlock-dao/)**: A decentralized organization of
token holders who govern and control Unlock Protocol.
- **Unlock Tools**: Front-end convenience applications built by Unlock Labs to
further sustainable innovation on Unlock Protocol.

Unlock Labs created Unlock Protocol to provide an open, shared infrastructure for
memberships that removes friction, increases conversion, enables scale, reduces
costs, and evolves the web from a business model built on attention toward one
based on membership.

Unlock Protocol belongs to the Unlock Ecosystem, not Unlock Labs, and is governed
by the [Unlock DAO](../../governance/unlock-dao/).

We aim for Unlock Protocol to be the primitive for every membership, both online
and offline, around the globe. Together, we will create an internet owned and
monetized by creators and their supporters.
