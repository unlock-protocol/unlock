Grants give projects building on Unlock Protocol a voice in the Unlock DAO. We believe that grantees will continue to engage for a long term and sustainable future for the protocol since they have a vested interest. In addition, healthy ecosystem growth happens through application integrations, education and events. Grants from the Unlock DAO can help the entire ecosystem run smoothly and increase network volume, add to credibility and boost the visibility of Unlock Protocol.
