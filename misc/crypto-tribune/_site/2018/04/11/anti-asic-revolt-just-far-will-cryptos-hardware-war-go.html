				<h2>The Anti-ASIC Revolt</h2>
				<p>11 April 2018</p>
			</header><p>Can public cryptocurrencies stay public?</p>

<p>That’s the simple question that lies at the heart of a complex debate happening across major cryptocurrencies, where developers from projects as diverse as ethereum, monero and zcash are up in arms over what to do about the arrival of a new form of hardware that could upend the delicate balance of their distributed communities.</p>

<p>Designed specifically to enable operators to earn a greater share of their networks’ rewards, “application specific integrated circuits,” or ASICs, have emerged to mine a handful of cryptocurrencies that were previously only able to be secured by those using GPU hardware.</p>

<p>At stake, however, is the very access and openness of the protocols themselves.</p>

<p>Stepping back, it’s important to unpack just what occurs during the “mining process,” a somewhat complex phrase that denotes the practice by which anyone can theoretically devote spare computer hardware toward running and securing blockchain networks.</p>

<p>Ethereum, monero and zcash can all be mined today with GPU hardware, graphics cards sold at major computing stores and that are available for only a few hundred dollars. More expensive ASICs, however, are specifically designed for an optimized mining process, and that’s at the heart of some of the complaints against the arrival of this new slew of products.</p>

<p>That’s because, as bitcoin has proven in the past, GPUs won’t be able to co-exist with ASICs, as their arrival is likely to push the hashrate to a level where other types of miners will become unprofitable.</p>

<p>And the threat and opportunity that lies ahead is now splitting cryptocurrency users, many of whom may have invested previously in products that are now effectively obsolete.</p>

<p>A miner going by the handle “fpbitmine,” for example, went so far as to accuse zcash creator Zooko Wilcox of not doing enough to support those who have invested in helping the network gain value.</p>
