[HackFS](https://hackfs.com/) is a hackathon organized by the EthGlobal and Protocol Labs teams. The goal of the hackathon is to build the foundation for the decentralized web! At Unlock, we embrace this mission and have decided to join by sponsoring the hackathon!

The hackathon started on July 30th and, teams have now submitted their projects! We're very excited to see that 17 teams have decided to build on top of the Unlock Protocol! You can view all of their submissions [on this Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrN4lIsh3yXQLQKh/tblfEgiZwI8Iog8ZK)

It is very important for us to involve the Unlock community on deciding what are the best ways to promote and grow adoption! For this reason, a few weeks ago we announced that we would [decentralize our grants review process](https://unlock.community/t/decentralizing-the-grants-process/106)!

Today, we want to try something new: let all of our community members vote on what the best projects from HackFS are!

We have created a [Snapshot proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/unlock-community.eth/proposal/QmXxsMZaoRarg8XbQJy7ceGXPGgAgH66HmvPzcs1q8kC1x) to let all community members vote! In order to vote, you need an Unlock NFT membership to this lock.
