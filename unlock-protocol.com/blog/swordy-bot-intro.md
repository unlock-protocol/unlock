## How it works

It uses complicate machine learning... just kidding! It's actually pretty simple. The bot checks the user's wallet for the appropriate Lock. If they have it, then the user earns the appropriate roles.

The basic steps for setting up the bot are:

Step 1. Add the bot to your server at [swordybot.com](https://swordybot.com)

Step 2. Add the requirements for a role using `!add-lock`

Step 3. Get a role using the `!unlock` command
