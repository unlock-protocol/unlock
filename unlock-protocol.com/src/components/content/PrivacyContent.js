      <SubTitle>What Personal Information does Unlock collect?</SubTitle>
      <Paragraph>
        The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and
        improve the Services and Services. We collect the following types of
        information from our users:
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Em>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</Em> In order to use certain
        features of the Services, you must first connect your Ethereum wallet to
        the Services. We receive and may store any information you enter via the
        Services or which is provided to us in any other way. Some of the
        information we collect and store could be personally identifiable
        information (&ldquo;
        <Strong>Personal Information</Strong>
        &rdquo;) which may include your Ethereum address, name, physical or
        mailing address, email address, phone number, credit card and/or other
        payment information, IP address, browser information, use information,
        username, password, and any other information necessary for us to
        provide the Services.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you
        may not be able to take advantage of our features. The Personal
        Information you provide is used for such purposes as answering
        questions, sending product updates, and communicating with you about
        Unlock&rsquo;s products and services, including specials and new
        features.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Em>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</Em>
      </Paragraph>
      <UnorderedList>
        <ListItem>
          We receive and store certain types of information whenever you
          interact with the Services. Unlock automatically receives and records
          information on our server logs from your browser including your IP
          address, cookie information, and the page you requested.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such
          as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Services and its
          components. We only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a
          statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you
          personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how
          often users use parts of Services so that we can make the Services
          appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As
          part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information
          to our partners about how our users, collectively, use the Services.
          We may share this type of statistical data so that our partners also
          understand how often people use the Services, so that they, too, may
          provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Unlock never
          discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would
          identify you personally.
        </ListItem>
      </UnorderedList>
      <Paragraph>
        <Em>E-mail Communications:</Em> We often receive a confirmation when you
        open an email from Unlock if your computer supports this type of
        program. Unlock uses this confirmation to help us make emails more
        interesting and helpful. We also compare our user list to lists received
        from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages
        to our users. When you receive e-mail from Unlock, you can opt out of
        receiving further e-mails by following the included instructions to
        unsubscribe.
      </Paragraph>

      <SubTitle>What about Cookies?</SubTitle>
      <UnorderedList>
        <ListItem>
          Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your
          computer&rsquo;s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems
          to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site
          are visited and by how many people. Please note that we may use
          cookies to enhance visitors&rsquo; experiences, to learn more about
          their use of the Services and to improve quality.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which
          will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as
          (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing
          you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.
          We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however,
          because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of the Services
          most attractive features.
        </ListItem>
      </UnorderedList>

      <SubTitle>
        Will Unlock share any of the Personal Information it receives?
      </SubTitle>
      <Paragraph>

        business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone.
        We share your Personal Information only as described below. We may
        disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that
        does not identify any individual, without restriction.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Em>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</Em> We anticipate that we
        may become affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with
        them. In certain situations, these businesses may sell items to you
        through the Services. In other situations, Unlock may provide services,
        or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily
        recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your
        transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related
        to such transactions with that affiliated business.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Em>Contractors:</Em> We engage with other companies and individuals to
        perform tasks on our behalf and may need to share your information with
        them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you
        differently, Unlock’s suppliers do not have any right to use your
        Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to
        assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of your Personal
        Information for the above purposes.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Em>User profiles:</Em> User profile information including users&rsquo;
        name, email address, and other information you enter (&ldquo;User
        Submissions&rdquo;) may be displayed to other users to facilitate user
        interaction within the Services. Email addresses are used to add new
        User Submissions to user profiles and to communicate through User
        Submissions. Users&rsquo; email addresses will not be directly revealed
        to other users by Unlock, except, when the user is
        &ldquo;connected&rdquo; to another user via a shared group membership,
        or an invitation, or if the user has chosen to include their email
        address in their user profile.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Em>Communication in response to User Submissions:</Em> As part of the
        Services, you will receive from Unlock email and other communication
        relating to your User Submissions. You acknowledge and agree that by
        posting such User Submissions, Unlock may send you email and other
        communication that it determines in its sole discretion relate to your
        User Submissions.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Em>Promotional Offers:</Em> We may send offers to you on behalf of
        other businesses. However, when we do so, we do not give the other
        business your name and address. If you do not wish to receive these
        offers, please send an email with your request to
        hello@unlock-protocol.com.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Em>Business Transfers:</Em> Unlock may go through a business
        transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of
        all or portion of our assets. In these types of transactions, user
        information is typically one of the business assets that are
        transferred. Moreover, if Unlock, or substantially all of its assets
        were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Unlock goes out of business
        or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that
        is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such
        transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Unlock may continue to use
        your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as
        subject to the acquirer’s policy.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Em>Protection of Unlock and Others:</Em> We may release Personal
        Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to
        comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other
        agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Unlock, our
        employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information
        with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit
        risk reduction. You acknowledge and consent to such disclosure.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Em>Compliance with the Agreement:</Em> We may use Personal Information
        to the extent it is required to enforce or apply our Agreement [INSERT
        AS LINK TO TERMS OF USE] and other agreements, including for billing and
        collection purposes.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Em>With Your Consent:</Em> Except as set forth above, you will be
        notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third
        parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
      </Paragraph>

        </ListItem>
      </UnorderedList>
      <Paragraph>

        from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. It is your
        responsibility to ensure that there is no unauthorized access to your

        have finished accessing your account.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>

        internet is not completely secure. Unlock cannot guarantee the security
        of user account information and unauthorized entry or use, hardware or
        software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of your
        user information at any time. If you are not comfortable with the
        inherent risks, do not share or provide Personal Information to the
        Services.
      </Paragraph>

      <UnorderedList>
        <ListItem>
