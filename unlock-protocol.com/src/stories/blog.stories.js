This is some sample markdown content for the purposes of displaying a blog post within Storybook. You can edit this
markdown content within the blog post story itself.

## How can I write blog posts?

Blog posts are written as markdown files and saved in /static/blog/. They will be displayed in file order. Publish dates
are intentionally not generated from this file date, in case we want to override the date.

 * You can use any standard markdown
 * All you need to do is edit the markdown file and the system will do the rest
 * The blog uses standard components and system styles so there is no separate style system to maintain

## Anything else?

**Here is some bold text.** We can also _italicize text_ or [link to outside websites](https://unlock-protocol.com).
