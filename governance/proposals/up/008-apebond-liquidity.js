### Goal of the Proposal

This proposal aims to transfer additional UP tokens to the ApeBond treasury address to make up for the deficit in the amount needed to establish a bond sale due to the UP token price drop. The original proposal was intended to have a bond sale of $80,000 but due to recent conversations on discord it has been reduced to $40,000.
