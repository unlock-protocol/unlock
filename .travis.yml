##
# This the travis config for Unlock's all project
# We use docker to run CI
# We need 2 images for this purpose:
#  - a generic `unlock` image which contains the code for the app, ready to run (deps installed)
#  - an image for puppeteer tests (`unlock-integration`) which contains only the required file for that purpose.
# (The generic unlock image can/will be used for actual deployment)
# TODO: To speed things up, both image building processes could be runnning in parallel.
# Once the images are built, we run test script using them.
# The `unlock` image is used for all services tests (smart-contracts, unlock-app, locksmith)
# The `unlock-integration` is used to run the integration tests
# TODO: To speed things up, all of the test scripts could be run in parallel.
# If tests are run successfully, we deploy to netlify and push the updated images.
# Both of these steps could be run in parallel
