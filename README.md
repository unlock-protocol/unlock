> Unlock is an access control protocol built on a blockchain. It enables creators to monetize their content or software without relying on a middleman. It lets consumers manage all of their subscriptions in a consistent way, as well as earn discounts when they share the best content and applications they use.

## Demo

We recorded a screencast to show how Unlock works for a paywall. (Note: this video is a few months old and outdated but still shows the "user flow" pretty accurately.)

We are building this in the open, which mean you can run the code locally (see instructions below).
You could also try out the staging version - which runs the latest, in-progress code - at https:://staging.unlock-protocol.com.

## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Unlock! We're excited you're here. There are a variety of ways to contribute to the project.
Please read more about contributing in our [contributor guide](https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Please also check our [code of conduct](https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for all participants in our community.

## Getting started

1. Ensure your dev environment is correct

unlock requires node version 8.11.4, and the latest npm in order to build. You can ensure that npm is the latest version with:

```
$ npm i -g npm
```

To manage node versions, there are several options. If you are using nvm, note that the default version of npm installed with
node version 8.11.4 is outdated, and will result in several node-gyp errors. Upgrading npm will fix these errors.

2. Check out the code from this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock
cd unlock
```

3. Install all deps

This will install all dependencies required for all the Unlock components (smart contracts and react app).

```
$ npm install
```

4. Run the app (this should also compile and deploy the smart contract to a local truffle node)

```
cd unlock-app && npm run dev
```

## Running tests/ci

We deploy with docker/docker-compose:

```
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.ci.yml build
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.ci.yml up --abort-on-container-exit
```
