This repository includes all the code deployed by Unlock, including smart contracts and the web app running at [unlock-protocol.com](https://unlock-protocol.com).

> Unlock is a membership protocol, built on a blockchain. It enables creators to monetize their content or software without relying on a middleman. It lets consumers manage all of their subscriptions in a consistent way, as well as earn discounts when they share the best content and applications they use.

## Demo

[You can try Unlock using the Ethereum blockchain on our homepage.](https://unlock-protocol.com/)

We are building this in the open, which means you can also run the code locally (see instructions below).
You can try out the staging version - which runs the latest, in-progress code, but against the Rinkeby test network - at [https://staging.unlock-protocol.com](https://staging.unlock-protocol.com).

Finally, you can learn more [on our documentation wiki](https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock/wiki).

## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Unlock! We're excited you're here. There are a variety of ways to contribute to the project.
Please read more about contributing in our [contributor guide](https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock/wiki/Getting-Started). Please also check our [code of conduct](https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for all participants in our community.

## Getting started

### The code

Unlock uses a monorepo which includes all the services and applications we develop.

```
# get the code
git clone https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock
cd unlock
```

You'll need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed globally.

```
yarn
# install all dependencies (...may take a while)
```

To execute commands inside the repo, we use the pattern `yarn workspace <workspace name> <command>`

```
# build the contracts
yarn workspace @unlock-protocol/smart-contracts build

# validate lint for paywall
yarn workspace @unlock-protocol/paywall lint

# etc.
```


### The protocol

You can run a local version of the protocol using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/). 

```
cd docker && docker-compose up --build 
```

This will create the required infrastructure (database, local ethereum test network, subgraph...) and start core services such as the [Locksmith](./locksmith) API and a [Wedlocks](./wedlocks) mailing service for debug purposes.

NB: config is defined in both `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml`.

### Deploy and provision the contracts

The following script will deploy the contracts, create some dummy locks and send you some local tokens for development.

```
cd docker
docker-compose exec eth-node yarn provision
```

### Run one of the app

The main dashboard lives in the `unlock-app` folder of this repo. 

To launch it locally:

```
# install deps
yarn 

# start Unlock main app
yarn worskspace @unlock-protocol/unlock-app start
```

This will start 

-  `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` to start using the application and deploy locks locally. 
-  `http://localhost:3002` our static landing page site.


### Config and environment variables

If you run the app locally on you machine, you will have to create a file called `.env.dev.local` at the root of the repo, containing variables for the different apps :

```
# your wallet address to the first line
ETHEREUM_ADDRESS=<your ethereum address>

# the ETH node
READ_ONLY_PROVIDER=http://localhost:8545

# core service URLs
LOCKSMITH_URI=http://localhost:8080
WEDLOCKS_URI=http://localhost:1337

# other optional services
DASHBOARD_URL=http://localhost:3000
PAYWALL_URL=http://localhost:3001
PAYWALL_SCRIPT_URL=http://localhost:3001/static/paywall.min.js
UNLOCK_STATIC_URL=http://localhost:3002
UNLOCK_TICKETS_URL=http://0.0.0.0:3003

# deployment
HTTP_PROVIDER_HOST=127.0.0.1
HTTP_PROVIDER_PORT=8545
ERC20_CONTRACT_SYMBOL=DAI
ERC20_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xFcD4FD1B4F3d5ceDdc19004579A5d7039295DBB9
BOOTSTRAP_AMOUNT=15.0
LOCKSMITH_PURCHASER_ADDRESS=0xe29ec42f0b620b1c9a716f79a02e9dc5a5f5f98a
```

Make sure you change the value of `ETHEREUM_ADDRESS` to use your main Ethereum address (the one you use with your Metamask for example). This will let you interract with the application using your regular setup.

NB: The environments config files for the infrastructure are located inside the [`./docker`](./docker) folder.
