This repository includes all the code deployed by Unlock, including smart contracts and the web app running at [unlock-protocol.com](https://unlock-protocol.com).

> Unlock is a membership protocol, built on a blockchain. It enables creators to monetize their content or software without relying on a middleman. It lets consumers manage all of their subscriptions in a consistent way, as well as earn discounts when they share the best content and applications they use.

## Demo

[You can try Unlock using the Ethereum blockchain on our homepage.](https://unlock-protocol.com/)

We are building this in the open, which means you can also run the code locally (see instructions below).
You can try out the staging version - which runs the latest, in-progress code, but against the Goerli test network.

## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Unlock! We're excited you're here. There are a variety of ways to contribute to the project.
Please read more about contributing in our [contributor guide](https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock/wiki/Getting-Started). Please also check our [code of conduct](https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for all participants in our community.

## Getting started

### The code

Unlock uses a monorepo which includes all the services and applications we develop.

```
# get the code
git clone https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock
cd unlock
```

You'll need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed globally.

```
yarn
# install all dependencies (...may take a while)
```

Build all packages:

```
yarn build
```

To execute commands inside the repo, we use the pattern `yarn workspace <workspace name> <command>`

```
# build the contracts
yarn workspace @unlock-protocol/smart-contracts build

# validate lint for paywall
yarn workspace @unlock-protocol/paywall lint

# etc.
```

### The protocol

You can run a local version of the protocol using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

```
cd docker && docker-compose up --build
```

This will create the required infrastructure (database, local ethereum test network, subgraph...) and start core services such as the [Locksmith](./locksmith) API and a [Wedlocks](./wedlocks) mailing service for debug purposes.

NB: config is defined in both `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml`.

### Deploy and provision the contracts

The following script will deploy the contracts, create some dummy locks and send you some local tokens for development.

```
cd docker
docker-compose exec eth-node yarn provision
```

### Run one of the app

The main dashboard lives in the `unlock-app` folder of this repo.

To launch it locally:

```
# install deps
yarn

# start Unlock main app
yarn workspace @unlock-protocol/unlock-app start
```

This will start

- `http://localhost:3000/locks` to start using the application and deploy locks locally.
- `http://localhost:3002` our static landing page site.

## Secrets

Secrets are stored in the Unlock Labs 1Password account in the `API & Services` Vault. They can be loaded in our Github Actions through the use of dedicated actions.

Here is an example:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Load secrets from 1Password
    uses: 1Password/load-secrets-action@v1.2.0
    with:
      export-env: true
    env:
      OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN }}
      USERNAME: op://secrets/test-api/username
      CREDENTIAL: op://secrets/test-api/credential
  ... more steps that require USERNAME and CREDENTIAL to be set
```

These reference URIs have the following syntax:
`op://<vault>/<item>[/<section>]/<field>`
So for example, the reference URI op://app-cicd/aws/secret-access-key would be interpreted as:
Vault: app-cicd
Item: aws
Field: secret-access-key
